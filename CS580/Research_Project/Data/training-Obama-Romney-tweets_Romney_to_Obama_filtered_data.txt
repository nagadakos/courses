Having a CAREER is important to me...Romney says college grads don't have jobs, yet I had 3 offers PRIOR to me graduating 
The only reason the unemployment rate is low because too many people have already lost their jobs Romney Dumb Ass......that made no sense 
Romney is not as on his game 
Romney is so shady its ridiculous.  He has no convictions about anything. 
Romney, no one cares cause you also have immigrants working at your house in Massachusettes. 
MIT Romney just contradicted his self. 
Romney:"I like Mexicans, as long as they came here on a private jet." 
Everybody knows Romney is lying he's a walking contradiction 
Never forget that! The middle class does not exist for Romney 
I just realized Romney looks like Mr Fantastic from the Fantastic Four. Not related to anything but I may have an idea for a reboot 
Romney is promising a bunch of crap that I'll doubt will ever happen. 
Romney is writing off the Latino vote. This is purely for his base. 
I agree 100% with Romney's immigration policy.   GET IN LINE BITCHES, GET IN LINE. 
finally! Romney said sum shit i like. 
Romney fucken up immigration -.- #LetItBe 
It took Mitt 3 tries to get Lorraine's name right. Deaf jerk. 
Romney is Tremendous Repeat.... he is trying to stay on his feet with the same Jabs 
Romney I have a question for you: are you personally better off now than four years ago? 
Kidding me?..Romney makes NO-SENSE on this immigration topic! 
It's Romney's time now. He's standing strong. Love it when he talks so much sense! 
Romney looks like a cartoon character. 
Yuck. Would Romney stop the bs hand jesters. We know which way down is 
just answer the damn question romney - #obamawinning 
Hahah well said Romney. If they're smart and have a diploma give em a green card 
FUCK ROMNEY! 
Romney: "You shouldn't have to hire a lawyer to get into this country legally." I think he just shat on an entire industry there. 
I don't think Romney answered her question let alone is going to do what he said! He does not care about immigrants! 
Romney: Some of my favorite servants are immigrants! 
Romney: "I would let immigrants become citizens by sending them to fight in Iran." #debate 
Watching the clock run out over Romney's shoulder is a delicious visual metaphor. 
Mitt can suck a dick. 
We are fucked if romney wins, smh.. How could ppl even consider voting for dis man ? Why is he running ? 
Mitt Romney is political Mad Libs. He'll say whatever you want to hear. 
Mitt Romney got adhd, he was waayyyy off topic 
Romney ass is a bitchh he DNT be talkin about SHYT relevant 
Romney just the other week called immigrants "the others". He has no plan for them. 
Romney is so unprofessional 
Romney was for shipping American jobs to China before he was against it. #debate 
Our America is middle class America. Our America is young America. Romney is trying to eliminate these things. Which is why he will not win. 
Romney is like a broken record.. 
A Romney presidency would be great unless you're poor, gay, Mexican, Black, a woman, a student, or a dog. #debates #leadfromwithin 
Romney thinks violence is caused by single moms . No boo , I was raised by a single mom along wit others I kno . &amp; we dont rely on violence 
Audience member: "Mitt Romney, do you like steak?" Mitt Romney: "Blue is my favorite color." #debates 
Romney you don't know the struggle of growing up in a single parent home.. 
Mitt's unsure about his gun policy, so he wants to talk about something he knows a lot about: women. 
Mr Romney, what color is grass?   Mitt Romney: "when the president took office...grass was something that needed to be cut, I love eggs... 
Romney keep saying "If I was president..." And "When I become president" BITCH!!!!! You're not gonna be the President!!! 
Of course Mitt blames single moms. Republicans believe everything unfortunate that happens to women is their fault. 
Wait. Romney is talking about two parent households on a AK-47 question? Now he pivots to Fast &amp; Furious. Mitt is LOST. 
Romney, Fuck around with yo fuck around, till you fuck around and get NO votes. 
#Romney cant even follow debate instructions, HOW CAN HE RUN A COUNTRY 
Romney said if you don't know your daddy, you ain't shit...cause your mama can't raise you. 
Romney: "Guns don't kill people, slutty moms do." 
Only piece of advice Romney should be giving the president...is how to run an Olympic committee not a country! #FB 
Mitt Romney completely lied on his stance on contraception–he would put your boss between women&amp;their docs http://t.co/E27Tj1xd #SketchyDeal 
Romney just keeps saying what he WANTS to do. Not what he's GOING to do. 
Romney will change the name of assault weapons to really good hunting rifles. 
Anyone else starting to think Romney may be the antichrist? 
Can't fucking stand Romney's ugly ass smerk in the backround 
Romney is such a dirt bag. 
I'm so tired of mitt romney's voice goodnight 
I think Romney would run a good company NOT a good COUNTRY!!! 
Mitt Romney reminds me of the guy in high school who only has friends because his parents have a swimming pool #debates #debate2012 
MR. ROMNEY How do u spell dog?  Well u see, dog is an easy word, while getting a burger in AL, a family came to me and said i lost my dog... 
So basically single mothers raise killers and dope boys? Work,Mitt. 
Mitt Romney is like a Best Buy employee trying to sell you something he cannot fully explain. #debate #debate 
Romney what color is the sky? Romney: That's a very good question. We had a sky back when I governed Massachusetts. I like flowers. 
Romney said he was given binders full of women. damn when they ton give me binders full of women. binders nigga. binders b 
Romney strikes me as a man without empathy. It may even be a pathology. Not a good quality in a leader. #2012Debate 
Romney look like he belong in a Viagra Commercial... 
I don't care what you think, Romney wants the rich to get richer, and the poor to get poorer. Equal America is not on his list. 
Wanna hear a joke? Mitt Romney. 
Mitt Romney is a humanitarian as long as you don't consider women humans. #debates #debate2012 
i wonder if the people who like romney actually know he's a homophobic racist sexist asswipe and just choose to ignore it. 
I love how Romney was like i care about 100% of the people. you literally just said 47% of the people pretend to be victims. get it together 
mitt looks very presidential to me when I mute the tv, close my left eye and look at him with only 47% of my right eye open! 
This isn't so bad for Romney.  He can easily win this without single moms, immigrants, the middle class or all women. #debate 
Romney just won me over! Done! Lets go vote! 
Romney talks about women like he's never met one in his life. 
Mitt Romney says "Government does notcreate jobs" so put me in charge and ill prove it? #Debate 
If Mitt Romney can't address the questions that the moderator asks, how will he address the issues that our nation faces ? #WeWantAnswers 
Mittjust said he'll create more jobs but not with trickle down govt. I don't think he understands how that works bcuz that's his PLAN 
Mitt Romney got caught LYING during the #debate by moderator Candy Crowley 
Any woman who votes for Romney must hate her rights, and have no self-respect. #ignorant 
I'm so confused as to what Romney's plan is, it changes every time. 
Mitt Romney is a humanitarian as long as you don't consider women humans. #debates #debate2012 
I don't think enough people touch on the fact that Romney acts just like a bully. 
also romney stop saying you made the Massachusetts education what it was... we all know that was #devalpatrick #tryagain #romneywho? 
Romney's body language and condescending tone towards women (including the moderator) shows the mindset of his sexist policies. 
I hired a woman once. Mitt Romney you are a true modern day feminist ugh props to you bravo etc 
Romney is a bully. 
Romney:  Government does not create jobs. Please give me this government job. 
Also remember when Romney said his plan for women was "flexible hours" so they can cook and clean for their families? Because FUCK. #debates 
Mitt Romney knows the pain of your middle class females. 
I applaud Mitt Romney for his patience. It must be frustrating to be interrupted every time he tries to speak; Unimpressed by the moderator 
Romney should be president. 
How totally fucked up that Romney links mass shootings to single parenthood. Wow. Just wow. #debate #debate2012 
So Romney has a binder full of women? No little black book? 
RT @americasvoice: Romney tries to walk back everything he said on #immigration during primaries #debates // which is a good thing 
During his Presidency the Deficit is now right under 1.1 trillion dollars! Quit lying Romney! 
Does Mitt know what a gallon of milk cost? Does he know what it feels like to tell your kids no cuz you can't afford it? #YouCantRelateToMe 
I'm suprised Romney let the debate go this late, though. Shouldn't Candy Crowley be home cooking dinner for her family? #debate 
I sincerely question the sanity of anyone who supports Mitt Romney. Especially at this point after he's said SOOOO many dumbass things. 
Mitt Romney: "I care about 100% of the American people. But if you're poor, you're as good as Chinese to me." #47Percent #hofstradebate 
Romney said borrow money from your parents for college" bitch I can barely get $5 from my mom, what makes you think I can get $30,000? 
Oh Romney your sexism and blatant racism would be funny if it weren't so real. #Romney The comments about China alone... Bro seriously? 
Romney was a disaster on immigration ... 
Romney has a binder full of women.  You know who else does?  Serial killers. 
Can't wait for Mitt to bring the iPhone factories to my neighborhood.  I totally need a job that pays a dollar per day. 
seriously though mitt romney's voice is FUCKING terrifying. 
Romney's immigration plan is going door to door with a Benjamin Moore Paint sample. If you're darker than Burnt Sienna, you're gone. #debate 
Were we the only ones who found Romney's immigration comments about his father being born in Mexico strange? 
Mitt Romney's immigration plan is apparently to send them to fight wars. Illegal immigrants for illegal wars! #MocktheVote

 I wonder when Romney became a pastor, dt is preaching in a debate. looooool 
 Romney said so much bull crap I don't even remember what the question was. #PresidentialDebate2012 
 "ill get america working again" -Romney. Hmm well you also just said government does not create jobs. Makes total sense... 
 65000 jobs is a lot of jobs on a population of 16 million people... but I would think that Romney should create jobs in his own country 
 Romney: "I understand what it takes to make a bright and prosperous future. My passion flows from the fact that I believe in God." #debates 
 If mitt Romney bought me a chanel bag I would vote for him prob. 
 Romney lies so much #youtubepolitics 
 Romney: blah blah blahModerator: governor...Romney: *totally ignores comment* blah blah blah 
 here it comes, hope Romney's ready 
 So Romney u was a pastor? its my understanding that a pastor is suppose to be truthful and set an example! #negative 
 I can't stand seeing ignorant comments about Romney from black people that totally don't even make since #pleasestfu 
 seperation of church and state is clearly going out the window if Romney gets elected. and thats not okay 
 Cheap shot referencing the 47% remark when Romney doesn't get a chance to respond. #debates 
 47% for the win! Debate over. You lost this one Romney. 
 Did I just hear Mitt Romney accuse Chinese people of hacking our computers? 
 @DividendTitan Wrong, President has encourage US business, It is Romney who has the track record for outsourcing and hiding money offshore 
 Romney Is Just Avoiding Question & Creating False "Facts" 
 Saving 47% for closing statement, no chance for Romney rebuttal? #genius #debate 
 Can we stop with the 47% thing? Nobody cares anymore. Romney slipped up. It happened. It's done. Let it go. #PresidentialDebates. 
 Win goes to Romney!!! 
 @littlekathzilla I honestly don't think Romney could do better. I don't even think he would try. He doesn't even care about minorities 
 Romney never used the word "victim" in his 48% remark. #debate 
 Romney was NOT talking about veterans, seniors, or truly disabled citizens.  He was talking about those on welfare that don't need it. #47% 
 Romney did incredibly well except for Libya (!?). Candy shouldn't have gotten into the semantics. Twitchy's fact check: http://t.co/3bosItAu 
 If Romney becomes president im moving to Italy 
 I'm at work missing the debate but from the looks of it Romney acting a fool I'm guessing... 
 Just realized I spent my 1,000th tweet bashing Mitt Romney. I'm cool with it 
 How embarrassing. Michelle Obama and Ann Romney wore the same dress. #debate 
 I don't know understand why Romney keeps saying that we are all under "the same God" are we really?I know some who won't agree with him! 
 I guess the main reason I don't like Romney is because I want religion out of politics 
 Romney won this debate! 
 Candy held Romney in check! 
 Was really hoping Romney would break out in song when asked to talk about who he really is. Maybe Beautiful by Christina Aguilera? 
 What about the 47%? Pure arithmetic means 53% only.. Romney doesn't care about 100% #debates 
 @Talkmaster and he was flat put lying. He know Romney wasn't talking about gi bills, SS and Medicare recipients. 
 Tonight's debate bound to hurt Romney with women voters & completely shoot down his hopes with single mothers. 
 Go home Romney!!!! 
 Too bad Romney didn't prep in Williamsburg. That debate could have been closer. 
 Romney is too secretive but no matter  who wins I'm gonna pray that the best person is selected!!! #GodControl 
 Who hasn't Romney offended yet?? 
 God, what a train wreck that was. Of course I believe Romney won; so many avoided answers from both sides though 
 What are you talking about Romney not answering questions? He was pretty straightforward with almost all his answers. Not all but most 
 I think Romney has lost the bird vote tonight #debate #debates 
 Romney is charging $5 an autograph !!!

 If This Cracker Romney Win...I'm Moving To China...Imma Become The Next Karate Kid!!! 
 #debates Romney did Good even if hindered by 2 democrats, Crowly&Obama 
 @timvandenack Nah Romney has already clarified it. I guess if you are naive you might buy it. 
 #fact if Romney wins, Chicago will not have a presidential visit for atleast 4 years 
 I think after this debate even Romney supporters should question his character 
 @KatieCumlander Romney said he believed in God. I know, it shocked me too! 
 So what's Romney's stance on tanning tax? I think that may be the deciding factor of my vote. 
 @SophiaBush This isn't so bad for Romney.  He can easily win this without single moms, immigrants, the middle class or all women hahah 
 What if Romney wins. 
 If your going for Romney you obviously don't wanna go to college 
 Post debate- people of color vying for Obama's attention. Fewer people around Romney. #debate

 @CarolineManzo I'd like Romney, just once, to be specific!   What exactly are the credits he plans to cuts to tax payers?   no answer 
 Haha I agree! The only thing Romney addressed with working women was making sure they get home to make dinner -___- lol #nobueno 
 If you're a woman voting for Romney, I have no respect for you since you obviously have no respect for yourself. 
 I'm in that 47% that Romney doesn't care about! 
 Romney working Fast and Furious into the commentary - despite getting slapped down by Crowley - was brilliant. @FoxNews #debate2012 
 To be real , theres WAY too much black people & wanna be black people for Romney to even think <-- of winning. 
 Romney seems to be a hot head redneck .... 
 this really proves how deep color is. bc if Romney is the only white option yet he does absolutely nothing for America, what are we doing? 
 all the reasons why Romney is a bad candidate have no political reasoning behind it....? #stop 
 Did anyone hear one single deduction Romney would close to pay for his ridiculous tax cut? #debate

 Are gay men included in the binders full of women, Romney? I'm not sure since you see neither as people. 
 O_o RT @msnbc: Romney somehow connects gun control to making sure people are married before they have kids. #msnbc2012 
 At the debate, Romney said he looked through "binders of women" to find female employees. That sounds like what I did with my last film... 
 Man Romney got all single mothers pissed right now 
 The debate was pretty even till the end. Then Romney hit a home run out of the park, while BHO continued to equivocate. @Lrihendry 
 Romney you're a lost soul my man. Stick to being a "priest!" 
 Pretty sure Romney lost all the single parents votes talkin that bullshit! I didnt get married first and joshua wont round shootin ppl!!

 I'm still very disturbed about Romney comments on immigration..These are ppl w/ dreams and skills..Pay attention he threw them 2 the wolves 
 @BillSpadea @ChasingNJ I think Romney will lose ground because he was riding a wave of 1st debate.  If that slows its a net loss.

 Watching the debate with the hubby, and i must say that Romney is very disrespectful. smh. 
 Krautjhammer is wrong, Romney won on points. 
 Still irked. Response to a question about equality for women in the workplace, Romney was proud he let a woman go home early to make dinner. 
 I dislike Romney. A lot. 
 I still believe Obama did bad the 1st debate purposely... To have better knowledge & feeling on Romney. âœŠ 
 Romney for sure would have fought AGAINST us during the women's right movement. And oh God the civil rights movement?? #Obama2012 
 2nd reason , Mitt Romney family owned slaves . 3rd he hasn't fully given a direct legit plan on how he would make changes. 
 A lie is a lie. The truth is the true....... Mitt Romney likes to throw the rock and hide his hand.......... 
 Everyone whos voting for Romney I hope yall got money for college!!

 @ABC  I thought Romney was very rude to Candy. Is this how he will treat all women? 
 Crowley questions Romney math to his face. Did they clank audibly when she stood up? 
 Ladies, remember...Romney's idea of removing the glass ceiling is letting you leave early to get dinner ready #debate 
 My wife and daughter will NEVER be in your binder, #Romney. 
 @Xnives Oh Yeah, watched the whole thing...  Romney is a Liar, he's never to the point, and He's not going to make a good president. 
 @Hobokiller26 Romney used it as an example of spending cuts he would make to reduce federal budget 
 But during his political career, Romney has flip-flopped on whether he actually wanted to serve in Vietnam. 
 Looks like Romney won. #MERICA 
 @PoliticalTicker I refuse to take a 2$/hr job, as Romney would have it by magically bringing jobs back from China #CNNDebate.

 How much do u want to bet that all my lovely Clemson belles except one, watched the debate, still don't understand and still, back Romney. 
 Sorry Romney but I was raised by my mom only....I apologize for being a success and defying your theories... 
 Job Done. Hopefully it will stop Romney's momentum. Unlikely to shift polls much though. 
 Oh god, "clashing protests" on Hempstead Tpke? That must have been uncomfortable for the Romney supporters. 
 Why does Mitt Romney keep citing studies after saying they aren't reliable in the first debate? #PDSLive 
 @Follow_Me_Ho3 BOL ! I Liked When Romney Interrupted Him And He Was Like "It's Okay, I'm Used To Gettin Interrupted . Romney Has No Manners"

 @SamFeistCNN but let me guess they loved Romney lie about 100% 
 Maybe Romney should go run him a business and leave our president to run this country.. 
 @markdewes But markets are global and the companies that Romney is fighting for support China's actions through their actions. 
 If Ann #Romney can't get Mitt to respect women and their reproductive rights he is indeed a lost cause. 
 That's cool that Romney's state is ranked first in education in a country ranked 31st, way to go bro #debates 
 Funniest part of the #debate was when Romney talked about the 'Binders Full of Women.' I would love to see these binders :-) 
 @speechboy71 Exactly. It could be Romney's worst debate at the worst possible time 
 @KarlRove not to mention  all of CC's interruptions of Romney and correcting him and directing BO how to answer. 
 @maumau_correa 1. How do you prosecute a state that's shouldering most of our national debt? 2. Romney's hypocritically invested in China. 
 I believe him. #Romney #debate2012 
 You all call people who are voting for Romney all these horrible things, but I can guarantee you they aren't. 
 I don't trust Mitt Romney tho. I genuinely feel he doesn't care a bit for anyone who isn't well-off enough to help further his own interests 
 @TVMoJoe I believe Romney was saying that the Pres. was out apologizing for an unrelated issue & not discussing what really happened. 
 Romney-bot suffered a partial break down resulting in him not going to shake hands with the crowd. After a few repairs, he was functional.

 @michellemalkin  Mitt Romney won given it's 2 against 1.  Why do these moderators think they have to help O? 
 By Oprah, so Romney knows how to handle money. 
 Romney is brilliant at taking a hard question and stepping around the answer with a complicated word salad. 
 I feel that Mittens Romney is not only a liar, but he is very rude. i was appalled that he specifically told the moderator "no" 
 "I hired a woman once." -- Mitt Romney, Paragon of Feminism and equality.

 @BretBaier @foxnews @megynkelly good job! Tough debate but good show for Romney! 
 Unless your family is making 250,000 a year, you're not middle class to Romney and he's not going to help you. 
 Why is everybody like "Romney better not be president!" i mean he is obviously not gunna win... -_-

 Just realized that both, did not answer major questions - Romney, on how the math in his tax plan makes sense. #POTUS on the Libya incident. 
 John Kerry calling Romney inconsistent. LOL. 
 You can look at Romney face during the debate...that "little fella" was shooked! No little boys in a Big Boy's game kid! #BarackObama2012 
 Actually Romney did do bad at all tonight. All that he did was say what he needed to say, and he said it clearly. #ClearlyTheWinner 
 @edshow Romney's disrespect to Candy shows how he bullies women 
 Romney: I will create more jobs, I know how, I will do it. Student: Okay, how?Romney: I will create the jobs. Student: -______- 
 John Kerry: Mitt Romney keeps changing.... You just can't trust this guy. 
 I heard that Romney was a morman? Dont know if thats true, but I know some other Mormans and their no different, and they are really nice. 
 When his turn came on the Libya question, why didn't Romney just say "Mr. President, answer the question?  Who denied the add'l protection?" 
 I think Romney DOES care about the 47%...he cares that they've now heard his conversation. XD 
 Romney loves to say he ran & balanced the budget of the Olympics, Romney got most of that $$ from the federal govt. #biggovtgettingthing ... 
 Basically if Romney is elected everyone can kiss their freedom goodbye ðŸ˜˜ 
 #Debate would be better if Romney & Obama wore top hats. 
 President Obama to Mitt Romney: "My Pension's 'Not as Big as Yours'" | watch: http://t.co/swi1GKGN #debates @ABC 
 i stayed off twitter so i could form my own opinion about the #debates and in my opinion @MittRomney did great. #Obama was a hot headed fool 
 â€œ@aurosan: Things I learned tonight about Mitt Romney's platform: Single moms, China and brown people are the cause of America's problems.â€ 
 is it just me or does Mitt Romney Look like Mr. Stretch from the Fantastic 4 
 if you are looking for a good halloween costume - Romney's "Binder full of women" 
 i cant understand how anyone could say that Mitt Romney won either debate wen we found EVERYTHING that he said to be lies and not plausible 
 Romney: "The government doesn't create jobs." AND "If you elect me I'll create 12 million jobs." Which is it? Finkle is Einhorn! #debates 
 @orangeinah Still think I'm voting for Romney now. 
 Keep in mind before these debates started I wasn't too enthused with Romney. Also keep in mind they've been talking economy. 
 @Foster_Vann you sound like Romney? Atleast Romney talks in the debates 
 Lol the Republicans know Romney is #Losing but they're trying to be optimistic saying Romney did a good job 
 People who think Mitt Romney is completely cutting financial aid couldn't be more wrong.. 
 #Debates Sorry MSNBC. Frank Luntz on @seanhannity undecided voter group HEAVILY for Romney. Vote changers. All said BHO defensive #tcot #p2 
 "If ANYONE on ANY cable/broadcast network says MittRomney won this debate or thiswas a draw, they are a flat outfool" ~ Rowland

 @joerogan I think Romney is better because he's basically a used car salesman to me. 
 #Romney labels China a "currency manipulator" - I would not bite the hand that feeds you. Great policy 
 @neo99934 @MittRomney @BarackObama Mitt Romney Just became PRESIDENT tonight! 
 A vast majority of Americans exploit social welfare. While I'm no Romney fan.. There is some truth to th 47%. 
 Sorry, Candy Crowley, that Romney was so rude to you. #TeamBarack #presidentialdebate #MittLies #debate2012 
 .@John_Ondo Bc I thought it was a draw. Have my rundown on my TL. Didn't think Romney did as well as the undecideds seem to. Great news! 
 @Gibson_2012 But if you are voting for Romney, what you supposedly are going to get are "lowered taxes." 
 My main problem w/ Romney is his plan to make all the illegals leave. Who is going to make all the tacos??? #FlawedPlan #Debates 
 Who do you think won the debate?Romney or Obama? 
 Romney clearly won that. Cant wait til this country is up and running again. #presidentRomney 
 Watched the debate for 5 minutes. Turned the station because Romney is annoying. I don't like either of them #voteforDonald #PresidentTrump 
 Not unexpected, though: panel said they were torn between Romney and not voting. Undecideds! 
 @timothy_stanley - Don't you think that was Romney's weakest point in the debate.  Romney should probably avoid all foreign policy to win. 
 @BretBaier Very surprised by the Hannity focus groups reactions, they were as adamant tonight that Romney won as they were last debate. 
 There is a big difference between living/going thru something and having others tell u about it.  Romney has no clue!! 
 @gretawire Romney won, he made his case, he is the next president of the USA! 
 Romney should be president. 
 Mitt Romney could not put Candy Crowley in a binder. Ha! #debate #debate2 
 Romney just sounds so much nicer when he talks. 
 Romney lost bad 
 Romney no where NEAR won the debate. He couldn't even answer one question with a straight answer. 
 If your voting because of race, remember that Abraham Lincoln was a Republican, and Mitt Romney's family Marched for Civil Rights. 
 CSPAN caller: "I noticed how much of a flippity-jibbit Romney was being." 
 @finneyk Romney had a female Lieutenant Gov and more females on staff than any other governor. Your argument doesn't hold water. Or truth. 
 Romney is terrible on stage, just like Senator Marco Rubio from Florida. 
 Kanye West should've came & interrupted Romney in the debate. 
 I don't know about equal pay.Romney  went through binders full of women as if qualified women are so hard to find! Romney=Wrong for women 
 Go Romney! Lets get the economy going again and get people to spend money! 
 I don't like Mitt Romney's platform or his speeches, this debate is over. 
 I just don't know Romney says he is going to do this and that but actually how what's your plan man give us a layout at less #TeamBarack 
 @MelissaNagy1 @StephieT_31 yup i can believe it. Romney is a evil prick. Like the time he walked a blind professor into a door on purpose. 
 @IngrahamAngle Romney was thrown off balance on Libya by Crowley interjecting a debatable point as fact#shameless 
 Fox focus group significantly showing support for Romney 
 "I appreciate windjobs in Iowa," stands as the raunchiest thing Mitt Romney has ever said. #Debate 
 @cnnbrk Romney said undocumented people born/living in USA can serve in the military or gov. will make their life so difficult they'll leave 
 Romney said the government doesn't create jobs. Why is he talking about all the jobs he can create? #TeamBarack #debate 
 @maddow: At least Romney would get us women home in time to get in the kitchen and cook dinner #oldfashionedmanthink 
 Sure the Romney people won't cry over spilled milk...that's what we are here for! @crowleycnn #cnn 
 @MagandaAkoAy so is there anything wrong being told that? People voting for Romney have the right to vote for whoever they want, right? 
 @gretawire Loved Romney!  Proud of Romney for standing up to the lies. You go dude! http://t.co/TfRnCtdv 
 Tonight's description of Romney- Snooty, elite, disrespectful, entitled, cheesy, wrong, insincere, distant, aloof, exposed and dishonest. 
 @dwas_0305 their feet & Romney being a "good man of God" should understand that & help those people too instead of try to take away things 
 Mitt Romney's lies are not the biggest problem, it is our inability to listen to his truth. 
 @joshtpm Candy did great too many times Romney get's away with lying to the nation about time he was called out with un-disputable evidence 
 @AndreaTantaros Wish Romney pursued those areas more vigorously. Candy's bias didn't help either. 
 I'll be honest, the only tidbit I've learned about either candidate is that Romney is a huge fan of The Killers. Now that's interesting. 
 "Very little of what governor Romney just said is true" #themeofthedebate 
 Romney stated government cannot create jobs then in the same sentence he promised to creat 12 million jobs...LMBO!!! #Idiot 
 Know your facts Mr. Romney before you bully "No acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great nation" http://t.co/m9x7FKiO 
 "We just can't afford four more years like the past four years." -Romney #RomneyRyan2012 
 Rachel Maddow is reporting that Republicans fled the post debate spin room...They went biblical on "fled " Romney did too! #maddow 
 @AndreaTantaros.  Don't you think it would help Romney if he would say I'm not for abortion being used as birth control. 
 Without the mainstream media, Romney would have been ahead long before the debates. 
 Romney rules end of storyy 
 God is in control of everything!  I thank Him for the platform He has given me!  I respect everybody's opinion but Romney 2012!! #Godis1st 
 & #Romney said NO Taxcuts 4 Rich, just 4 middle-class. Again, unlike what he's on the record saying he'd do! 20% tax cuts 4 All,NOTpossible! 
 How much R Koch Bros.  Adelson & ?? paying Romney & Ryan 2 destroy middle class?Could they help homeless with that money... Why not? 
 Romney be LYINGGGGGGGG!!!!! 
 Romney Says he'll crack down on China and stop migrating manufacturing jobs to China! Really? America is made in China!!! 
 @IngrahamAngle Yes, Romney blew that opening. Damn.

 Can someone make a joke about how Romney *would* put women in a bind? I can't be bothered. 
 Dear Mitt Romney: please forward those binders of women along when you get a chance. Thanks much! 
 Didn't your mother teach you it was rude to interrupt, and point your finger in peoples faces Mr. Romney #Rudeashell 
 Dude, Romney/Ryan, I respect you, but damn, you're not what we need. A shift in political authority is not ideal at this moment. #Paradigm 
 During the debate, Romney just repeated himself, changed positions when it was convenient

 For some reason my tweets were sent today...whatever...Romney is the man that will  lead America and bring jobs back 
 Good morning everyone, I hope you have your BINDERS today,like Romney and his binders of women. 
 Gov. Romney looked strong on the economy tonight. Also acted more Presidential. I'm looking forward to his leadership for the next 4 years! 
 Hahahaha did Romney really just say he caresabout 100% of the American people!? #bullshit #47Percent #youdontgiveashitaboutus 
 Honestly I do agree with Romney on the  unwed parents. It too kids having kids now in days. Too mutts, smuts, and nuts running round. 
 How can you support Romney when he is so  anti-women's rights? 
 I bet Obama has a #binderfullofwomen Romney certainly isnt the only one to have one! 
 I feel like if Romney win he gone abuse his authority 
 I guess I'm not in the top rich 1% because i don't have #bindersfullofwomen. I'll work hard in the next life to have Romney s binder 
 I prefer Romney though. Obama was talking things he had no idea about. How can you be talking about budgets based on what 'advisers' say?

 My 17 year old son was fact checking Mitt Romney during the debate last night. Mitt definitely kept him busy. 
 My great objection to #Romney is his mistake belief that insurance is the only way to fund health care & we must be forced to buy insurance. 
 Not only that. But Mitt Romney is comfortable with disrespecting the president. The president is still the president. 
 One thing is clear, Mitt Romney prefers binders full of women more than binders full of facts. 
 So after have followed the 2nd #debate I would want Mr. Mitt Romney to win the presidential elections !#debate2012 #President #Romney 
 The only thing Obama could beat Romney at is  golf. 
 The truth finally comes out on Romney's  lies#2012Debate 
 There is also a videotape of Romney saying how he plans to do nothing and by doing that the economy will better itself.   What an idiot. 
 Voting for Romney as a female student shows your true ignorance to what's going on. 
 When Mitt Romney is president, I hope one of the first things he does is pass a law preventing Hollywood from making any more shitty movies. 
Women complain about everything. Even when allowed by Romney to go home early to cook dinner and get kids ready. Ingrates.

 @rupertmurdoch I'm getting the impression that you like Mr Romney. That would make you a very silly person. 
 Am I the only one who thinks Mitt Romney looks a bit like Will Ferrell? 
 you think Mitt Romney checks his mentions? 
 FACT: There were NO women partners at Bain Capital during Romney's time #bindersfullofwomen #Phoney #MorningJoe 
 On a political note, after the debate, would people still root for Romney? I sure hope not. 
 Mitt Romney makes me mad, when he was talking about jobs, but never explained how! Its like he's saying: "I will get you all a job" . . df. 
 Sitting in @Starbucks wearing my Romney/Ryan shirt & I'm the only person that hasn't been offered a free drink from the Verismo System. 
 @DRUDGE_REPORT  Mitt Romney is a relentless, bald-faced liar, a sociopath, a thing without a conscious: the devil. 
 "Gov. Romney doesn't have a 5-point plan. He has a 1-point plan... to make sure that folks at the top play by a different set of rules." 
 Mitt Romney is nothing more than a snake oil salesman peddling his bullshit to a Fox bubble head mentality! 
 @STARANDBUCWILD You voting for Romney cause you must have them investments in China. 
 Ready for the election to be over. I don't need anymore time to come to the conclusion that Romney is ridiculous. 
 I'm convinced that 99% of Romney voters are voting for him because he's white. 
 Only reason i'd support #Romney is because we both got binders full of bitches. Hahahaha. #notreally 
 - Mitt Romney's campaign is $25 million in debt. This is the guy that's gonna fix our economy? 
 @nahjaaa dead ass Romney going to be the end of America 
 Romney, if elected, will single-handedly create more enemies for the U.S. than BOTH presidents named Bush. 
 Stop picking on Romney for his #BindersFullofWomen comment. Having binders full of women is an important tenant of the Mormon faith. 
 @crowleyCNN Shame on you. You owe Mitt Romney and apology and explanation! 
 Heres the thing about Romney: everything he said about women that we're all laughing about, he says those things because he has nothing else 
 @LupeFiasco what are your thoughts on Mitt Romney? #ImCanadian 
 "@FlawlessDelena: Ladies. Romney hates trees and women. Ian Somerhalder." 
 How can people even consider Voting for a LIAR like Romney? I'm not even sure he knows the difference anymore #questions #OTVB 
 Romney has my vote if he would make #bindersfullofwomen jokes through the day today on twitter himself. Lets laugh so we don't cry 
 Debate: Romney was as good as 1st Debate 
 Mitt Romney's behaviour in discussion is horrible :( 
 @mantone1 All points Romney should have made. 
 I woke up to so many Romney jokes from last nights debate. Lets leave this rich fortunate blessed white man alone. 
 @BretBaier Last night's debate sure did not change my mind. Proud of Gov. Romney!!! 
 I wanna puke everytime I look at Mitt Romney's face 
 Romney's Tax plan still sounds like magic. 
 "@devontemckee:Craziest thing ever on the web, if you google image "completely wrong" tons of pictures of Romney show up"Gives me #thecreeps 
 Romney's wife looks evil and creepy... 
 @Lindolini @vasuvasu Mitt Romney? That's a person's real name? 
 I will personally go canvassing for him door to door if Romney spends his entire first two minutes of the next #debates doing Gangnam Style 
 @bgardner Mitt Romney's house? 
 Told my mother I was voting for Romney so that she'll be able to come home from work and cook dinner for me 
 Donald Trump support Mitt Romney last night. 
 THAT was the Romney we all have come to know and (for some) loathe. 
 Vote for Romney #TerribleAdvice 
 @MarkHalperin Nothing brilliant about Romney last night  #bindersfullofwomen 
 After watching the debate I can honestly say that Mitt Romney is a fucking idiot. 
 @JansingCo Romney IS rude AND a bully.I thought he was going2jump on Candy.No comparison&yes I am a woman&he deeply offends me 
 This girl onside of me in my math classIs voting for Romney ! 
 Mitt Romney is an actual joke, he contradicts himself every debate 
 @MattBatzel Romney got schooled last night!  Romney was so disrespectful.  Loved when Crowley called Mitt out on one of his MANY lies 
 @TheFix I feel the same way about Romney lies, but after all we are talking about the media doing their jobs. #AintGonnaHappen 
 This girl in my class said it was okay for Romney to lie because that's how you win an election and she is still voting for him -___- #Wtf 
 I am going to vote for Romney. 
 After watching the full debate las night, i didnt think Romney did as bad as people been claiming. Theres def a huge bias on internet media. 
 Mitt Romney saved the Olympics WITH FEDERAL FUNDS 
 @scottRcrawford @guardian Sorry, but any man who calls himself a feminist deserves ridicule. Romney's only moderately more ridiculous. 
 #masdirin LOOK: Is Mitt Romney Stretching His Father's Mexican Connection For Votes? #news 
 If any female is voting for Romney you're an idiot... He's telling us we have no control over our body 
 Mitt Romney is a misogynist and his 18th century views on women make me sick. Any woman voting for him is in denial or has no self respect. 
 Mitt Romney has a "book filled with qualified women"... I think they call this a black book.  :) 
 Mitt Romney will create tons of jobs for women. Mother, wife, cook, maid, boo-boo kisser, sex-bot, etc. 
 Romney told 31 "myths" in 41 minutes - in other words, he lied 31 times. 
 Romney can't pronounce "legislation" and it annoys me. 
 @alexwagner Would love to hear how women feel about Mr. Romney's answer to the equal pay question. (Not male talking heads) 
 I wanna be Mitt Romney for Halloween. I feel like that's the scariest costume out there. 
 Wanna hear a joke? Mitt Romney. 
 @thehill Romney has no clue what we want. He is #binderfullofemptypages #debate #MittLies 
 @aravosis I think the binders comment reflects Romney's arrogance & self-centeredness: if it was done, obviously he must have thought of it. 
 Romney competent, assured, informed, steady. 
 "@blackenterprise: It's important to note Romney's answer on immigration tonight greatly differs from his answer during the primary #debate" 
 So when I die, bury me next to 2 binders full of women.- Mitt "2 Chainz" Romney 
 "what was Mitt Romney's big gaffe last night?" showing up? 
 how is Governor Romney suppose to crack down on China trade? 
 I'm so jealous of Romney, he has binders of woman, and I have to settle for folders :( 
 I wish someone had asked this last night: If the government cannot create jobs, why does Romney think he can create 12 million? #debate2012 
 @Gramzy7 Romney was so perfect on pointing out these facts. 
 A much better dig on Romney would be to point out that his response to equal pay was the gender equivalent to "Hey, I have black friends" 
 Romney do not know the true meaning of "middle class", "poor", "struggle" etc 
 I think that Romney showed how he doesn't respect normal (middle class) people by just putting up his hand and talks about what he wants! 
 It's national Ass day?... I think Mit Romney needs to get his contexts right. 
 On women's issues, Romney doesn't just talk the talk, he walks the walk. Just ask women who have worked for and with him. 
 Reading highlights of the US presidential debate, it's apparent one should wear a helmet while reading anything said by Romney. #facepalm 
 @FINALLEVEL When I watched Romney talk last night all I could hear in my head was @MrChuckD singing "He talking loud, ain't saying nothing" 
 @murielpaul8 @BeltwayBaca @MittRomney keep fighting for the american people thank you Romney 
 Romney is in. Now, he needs a Senate to  repeal the healthcare law, and to implement a sane tax policy. Focus on the Senate. 
 @DebtTrut no problem : ). I think we both r disgusted with Romney's bominable behavior. He is one mean guy who feels entitled to NO RULES! 
 Mr. #Romney, #Mexicans / #Latinos should not be referred to as #illegals. They are people with have #families just like you. #immigration 
 And he crushed the president on who would do a better job handling our deficit. Voters chose Romney on the issue by a margin of 59% to 36%. 
 Did Romney get those Lady Binders at Staples? 
 Mitt Romney looks like one of the muppets. 
 "Mitt Romney" needed to hire a recruiter to find the #bindersfullofwomen .Trapped In The Closet #gll GoDs Laughing Loudly 
 @kimguilfoyle Dont let bob get away w lie about Bengazy. Romney looked Presidental and won since he had the TRUTH and facts. 
 @realDonaldTrump Romney is just like you,criticisms but no solutions.You both treat running a business as If you were running a Country. 
 I'm rather angry about a lot of things this morning, and I can blame it squarely on Mitt Romney and Phil Ginsberg. 
 It's time for us to cut back on government and help the American People. -Mitt Romney June 8,2012 in Iowa 
 #Romney confirmed the stereotype, while floundering to explain how he wants to help women. 
 If Romney goes into office we might as well go back to being slaves in society. 
 @jtoy30 @dspoon2 I'm voting Romney cause he getting rid of birth control so I can finally be a baby daddy 
 @sydbrownstone: 10 bucks says next year there will be a #cmj band playing @cakeshopnyc called Romney's Binder. the next Sleater Kinney 
 Monica: "If we took out all the oil from Romney's hair last night the US could be energy independent." #Debate2012 #GObama 
 Reporters: 'Phase' is only rarely used as a verb. Romney was not phased by the questions last night. He was 'fazed' = disconcerted. 
 Mitt Romney is the Jame Gumb of politics: IT PUTS THE WOMAN IN THE BINDER, OR ELSE IT GETS THE NO EQUAL PAY HOSE. 
 @joebakes20 you walk like Romney 
 Romney seems like the kind of guy who still makes "women in the kitchen making sandwiches" jokes. 
 Romney obviously doesn't even watch the news, even during an election, so he didn't know what the Pres said the day after Benghazi! 
 Romney will magically become conservative and stop supporting what he has for decades if he wins. #LoL 
 Romney is full of horse shit. 
 @ladyblue49 I tweeted in the morning, and your night during debate using #Venuspeak if you read, I can prove Romney is weak in Math :-) 
 Every minute Romney and Ryan spend talking about Libya is time not spent talking about the economy. 
 @callumborchers joins us today for a debate fact-check of issues from Romney's time as Governor to see if the claims from both sides add up. 
 @kf4yfa - I saw some of the replays and was so proud of Romney for standing his ground - I love it when a man stands up for his beliefs!! 
 Watching that presidential debate again gave me a better understanding on why I dislike #Romney...I 
 #HistoricGhettoMoments #Romney'sjobplan: Employers make the rules and employees get screwed 
 There is NO presidential election story more newsworthy today than new #Gallup poll showing Romney up nationally 51-45. #election2012 
 @navarrotells When interrupted, you expect Romney to act like Obama did in the first debate? The moderator stepped out of line 
 @MartinBashir Of course Romney looked for women to work for him. He could pay them less and keep his payroll down. 
 Romney why you so damn dumb, I mean look at the decisions you want to make, We might as well jump our asses back to the 1800's ! -____- 
 Mitt Romney scored last night on both substance and style. 
 Mitt Romney disgusts me. He's so rude, and idiotic. I pray he isn't our future president. 
 And on the other side please explain to me why Romney would be a good president. Because I don't see anything that appeals to me at all. 
 What Planet  does Mitt Romney live on? Does He really think cutting taxes for the wealthy will create Job growth? is he a Mormon or a MORON? 
 USA would be in serious trouble if we somehow voted Romney into office. He is so short sighted just like most americans 
 Mum mentioned Mitt Romney earlier, I don't think I've hated someone has much as him, just knowing that he's breathing annoys me. #Angry 
 @ElfandSlater Listen to the rose garden speech before you say Romney was corrected. He never called the Benghazi attack an act of terror. 
 Romney balanced the Olympics budget with $1B in government funding and donated labor by union workers. #Forward2012 
 Look on the bright side, if Romney wins, maybe he'll start keeping his money in our banks. 
 Let me get political here Mr.Romney u can't bring the #fuel prices down but your rich ass homies could 
 The moderator had to interrupt Romney so much because he wouldn't follow the format of the debate. 
 @Dominic_Calvano True! At least Romney kept the lying to a minimal, didn't top his 27 lie record in the first debate. 
 If there's one thing I learned from Mitt Romney, it's that I need to store all my women in binders. Gotta tidy up around here. 
 Maybe if Governor Romney watched more Sesame Street his math would be better. 
 Romney looks like he lies to people to get more money 
 Can't wait to hear #Romney stumble through the foreign policy part of the debate next Monday. 
 That creepy smirk that Romney's always got plastered on his face seriously creeps me out... 
 @michellemalkin I think we need some 'Women for Romney' tee shirts made! #election 2012! 
 @GOP @Reince Romney has a plan to strengthen all of America. He has stated it time again. I don't know how any one is missing it. 
 Romney's 5 point plan: 1. Eliminate 2. You 3. Broke 4. Ass 5. Niggas 
 @jbarro  Though insistent that government can't create jobs, Romney promises to create 12 million jobs as president 
 Do you think that people should continue to receive Government Assistance if Romney is elected? Please let me know your thoughts on this. 
 #Romney Debate = Condescending, Boorish, Petchulant, Insincere, Defensive, Aggressive, Out of Touch, Disrespectful.  #Debate #tlot #tcot 
 Binder Full of Women, Plan Full of Holes - the new book by Mitt Romney 
 Dear Mitt Romney: "Illegal" is not a noun. Stop dehumanizing people! 
 .@Pudingtane Just imagine what Romney could have accomplished in those 3 1/2 minutes. 
 Romney was that one kid in class that asked why can't we just print more money 
 Romney: i will fix this issue by fixing this issue that is my plan 
 If Romney gets elected I won't feel obligated to pay taxes anymore :D 
 #IfIWasPresident Romney would be shipped to africa 
 I am shocked that there haven't been more Romney/BoM jokes. Come on guys! He's practically HANDING them to you! 
 Under Romney, Massachusetts was 47th in job creation. 
 To be fair, "Binders full of Women" is a pretty weak gaffe to be harping on.  Plenty more substantive reasons not to vote for Romney. 
 Remember: Romney's Mormonism admonishes women only to work until she has children. Then quit work, stay home to raise them #p2 #tcot #ocra 
 @djoddsox You do realize that Romney's plan is on his site, right? 
 Romney is so good that he could sell shaving cream to the Taliban. 
 Mitt Romney might win the erection and that scares me #foxnews 
 @MadcapAnthony If you can't see Romney's success, then you don't want to see it. You will never see it. 
 Romney really needs to stop mentioning birds and death together in any way shape or form. It's not helping him. 
 @notaxation Because of that mans actions and comments I will definitely vote Romney...some people... 
 I'd just like to point out that Romney wears more hairspray than most girls 
 Romney is a "PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE" NOT the PRESIDENT, & since all he does is point fingers at the Current he won't be the next 
 Romney has made some really good points in this debate. 
 Romney is just such a liar.. That's what ticks me off.. 
 Romney is not answering this question. I'm so shocked. #debates 
 Romney looks super young to be that old 
 HELL NO CHINA HASN'T BEEN CHEATING! Romney's just mad because China actually produces QUALITY products. 
 Mitt Romney answers questions so indirectly. 
 Romney will label China a currency manipulator. I label Romney a unicorn. #JustAsEffective 
 Romney makes some gawd awful faces.. 
 Romney clearly doesn't eat Chinese Food. Lmfaooooo for real! 
 Romney fuckin up by just curving the question 
 Romney's got Americans hating on China. China ain't stupid. #treadcarefully #debates #Current2012 
 I don't even wanna hear Romney talk anymore he pathetic !! 
 'Government does not create jobs.' True Romney, true. 
 Yes Romney please be specific! 
 Government doesn't create jobs but Romney sure took them away.. #pow 
 "Government does not create jobs."  Isn't that what you're promising Americans, Gov. Romney?  #debates 
 @NJohnston_45 HOW IS HE GONNA CUT IT if he has only 4 years!! Romney will make it 5356 times worse 
 Romney is pissing off my mom right now . Everytime he mentions china she rolls her eyes and calls him an idiot Lol 
 Romney needs to stop trashing China. Of they cut us off then were SCREWED! 
 Why can't Romney EVER stay on topic.!! 
 @edshow #debates Romney: government does NOT CREATE JOBS.  Romney running for government. Romney wanting to create jobs???? uhhhhhhh 
 "Government does not create jobs" -Romney WTF?! What the heck has Romney been promising this whole campaign!? JOBS! So he's lying again! 
 Romney don't care about me...Lyin ass 
 @alexwagner Romney just said Government doesnt create jobs. Then how is he gonna create jobs as President? 
 "Some campaigns are more focused on attacking a person than stating what they prescribe" REALLY Romney... you did that this entire debate! 
 Strong debate by Romney again. Love it 
 @DatB0iAlex Romney believes in god 
 Romney has so many things to brag about himself. I wish he was more comfortable doing it. 
 Did he just say he was a pastor? #Romney. 
 Romney brings up the 47% elephant in the room by talking about his passion for the 100% of Americans #debate 
 Romney doesn't care about America. You will not get my vote #assholeRomney 
 Excuse Romney, he talks in the third person sometimes. #debate 
 Now that Romney's talking about what we don't have to settle for... do we still have to settle for a third round of this? #debate2012 
 Romney and Obama did not shake after the debate. 
 Romney really is a dumb ass. He doesn't even want to listen to the president which means he won't listen to the idiots who vote for him. 
 Romney always having a family reunion on stage !!! 
 @iamashleymoran I think Romney is doin great 
 #Romney: "I know what it takes to create jobs".  Really?  Then why did you kill so many by bankrupting companies Bain purchased? 
 Romney is planning to cut Pell Grants. So if you're in college and you vote for him. YOU'RE STUPID 
 No one wants Romney's signature 
 #nbcpolitics Romney should have done more research on his Libya remark. 
 I mean after that Libya question how can u believe anything Mitt Romney promises? 
 If Romney is elected I'm moving to Canada. #PeaceOut 
 #Romney is still in prep-school #latism 
 Romney mad as shit looking like a dirty lizard. He thought he was gonna win this debate 
 It's to the point where if u vote for Romney, ur voting for a liar that's uncertain of even his OWN word. 
 @Salon_Politics Romney is 100% right. The mention of acts of terror was a general, generic mention. It was not specific to Libya. 
 Y'all. They are saying this is a strong debate for Romney. 
 This debate wasn't as much of a blood bath as the last pres. Debate but definitely a big victory for Romney 
 I just don't understand how Romney's against single parents and also against abortions, especially for those who've been raped. #logic 
 Romney sealed the deal tonight Great Job 
 I'm still shocked @ Romney connecting gun violence to single parents. 
 I will freak out if Romney wins the election 
 Romney is just trying to sugar coat things ! Like NO , just shut up !!! 
 Summary of Debate: "I can create jobs if you make me the head of government, which cannot make jobs." - Mitt Romney #debates 
 Romney is all for the Rich. 
 Mitt Romney don't know what section 8 is so how he gone expect to help the middle class 
 @jeremyjojola Romney needs to respect moderators a little more. 
 Most disturbing comment by Romney: that women in particular need "flexible work schedules." Must say, I am personally insulted. 
 The only good thing about Romney is that his sons are good looking. 
 @nytimes If Mitt Romney is elected, and he will be, 100% of us will prosper because we will have jobs!!!!! 
 Governor Romney had data, he just doesn't have the proper solutions. 
 Romney is officially unqualified for the job. If you don't think so, please don't vote. 
 Mitt Romney IS A JOKE 
 Mitt Romney says government doesn't create jobs - why does he keep saying he'll create 12 million jobs?? 
 I'm about to switch to Fox to hear how Romney did amazingly. 
 Romney has some explaining to do on the outsourcing of US jobs.... #Bain made him a millionaire. 
 God help this Country if Romney is  elected president 
 NONONO Romney just mentioned a god in the debate, that's never never never a good idea. Don't alienate people like that. 
 In 2011 Romney gave over 19% of his income to charity. 
no one wants to take pictures with ann Romney... because she is ugly. 
 Bush and Romney are two totally different people.. Yes they are both republican that's it! Romney will make a difference! #truth 
 @zachelias96 @maxcreynolds Idk wht percentages everyone should pay..I just know a bit about economics. But I think Romney is the best option 
 muthafuckas are voting for Romney just because hes a Republican and they claim to be Republican. 
 Romney's definition of workplace equity for women was letting them go home early enough to cook dinner. What an awful answer!! 
 @lovelyAirikahxX exactly. Romney would probably just mess it all up. 
 What?! Now Romney wants women to get home from work sooner so they can make dinner? Boys can learn to cook too, ya know! 
 For the record: I do not believe Romney could have stopped the attacks in Libya ... #vote 
 I'd rather have Bush in the office than Romney 
 @itsgabrielleu @Tyrese @johnlegend @aliciakeys  Romney's Solution to women's right is to get women home earlier to cook dinner.. 
 I wonder what Mitt #Romney's policies will be next week #debate 
 How tf did Romney pass English in school? I know his paragraphs was naked as shit without the supporting details and only a topic sentence. 
 If Romney doesn't win, I'm moving to Mexico. 
 Romney should really make sure he knows what hes talking about ... Smh ! 
 @donnabrazile That statements speaks volumes of how inept Romney would be as president. 
 "@lahoare: 2. Romney came off worse in the debate -- in fact, he looked like a real jerk #debate" 
 Romney wins again!  
 Mittens Romney is full of not knowing the struggles of hard working people 
 Honestly. If you are a #woman and you vote for #Romney, you must be #INSANE. #backwardsSociety if it's #Romney in #November. 
 Romney made a definitely grave mistake on the Benghazi issue#msnbc2012 
 Romney don't care if we kill each other! #tf 
 @RomneyResponse I thought Gov. Romney was terrific. He was not obnoxious, he was respectful but exacting.  Pres did not tell the truth. 
 It's nice that Romney wants to make sure women in the work force can get home in time to make dinner. 
 @billmaher Romney buried himself by trampling the female moderator while saying he cares about women. The dissonance was striking. 
 Romney wants to kick off some shit with other countries. If he wins, get ready for another World War soon after 
 @Jay_Severin Romney does well in the 2 on 1 format. 
 Romney said he sat cross the table from people who lost their jobs. That's because he fired them 
 @FoxNews  Go Romney, next time go into more about Lybia!!! 
 This is not the last word on Benghazi. Romney must revisit this in the third debate. 
 I couldn't tell you what color hair Romney has if you asked. Or if he even has hair? 
 Romney looks like such a lying asshole 
 Beautiful night for Romney!!  Looks good for Romney focus group favires Romney 
 If Romney win i really think there will be riots 
 I wanted Mitt Romney to talk more of his plan, then talking about how Obamas plan hasn't worked 
 At this point, it is clear that there is no cogent explaination for why anyone should vote for Romney. 
 I will be applying to McGill university in Montreal as an escape from America if Romney is somehow able to win 
 Romney's Tax plan sounds very sketchy. Blueprint to income tax evasion?Great idea for the 47% and our mutual funds @barac @MSNBCRachel

 This debate should clearly help the american people make up their mind, about who to vote for! Romney shown his truth self a bully and liar 
 #Romney did his best #VictorMeldrew impression tonight. #debate #UKView

 @TwitchyTeam Romney is. a Mormon not the devil 
 "What's the biggest difference between you [Mr. Romney] and George W. Bush?" Good question! 
 Romney did not answer the question about  Lilly Ledbetter that Prez signed on day 1 but he did have a binder full of women, how demeaning! 
 The best part of Romney's "close the loopholes" plan is the cap on charitable deductions. Because charity is killing the economy. #debate 
 @DntFckWitWorks: : Romney not helping anybody but the rich people. Making the rich richer and the poor poorer!

 @ATLjackie I think the bubble of wealth is much thicker than White House bubble. Romney shows pique at process like a CEO.  #debate 
 @tamronhall I think Romney know about that attack on Libya much more than he is saying.....Did he have hands in this? Wow! 
 #Romney says his tax plan "adds up", but won't tell us the arithmetic. #faithbasedeconomics #debate2012 
 @thinkprogress Boohoo - Romney lost because he had to answer questions from the actual middle class! Poor Romney! Only the rich should ask! 
 Romney said he's going to cut the middle class tax back. Does that mean redefining the classes to broke, rich, and welthy? @AsSeenAtIUP 
 Obama and Romney come across as hating each other but you know they're playing golf together this weekend and having a cookout. 
 That nigga Romney can't even stay consistent. How can you trust him? 
 "@chrisrockoz: A Romney presidency would be great unless you're poor, gay, Mexican, Black, a woman, a student, or a dog. 
 Sometime people have to know when to shut up. Romney is not the devil, he's not evil or etc. STOP IT. 
 When can you tell Romney is lying?  When he talks. 
 @chrislhayes Romney described a affirmative action success to add women to his cabinet 
 Is Romney trying to start something with China? He flat out called them terrorists. Not a good thing to say ...

Romney just said three time "Government cannot create jobs." umm so how does he plan on fixing things? 
@COURTNEYHALL_: Romney looks like he says nigger"all the time . Don't trust a guy with Grey sideburns just don't do it." 
All Obama has to say to rebut Romney is...the 47% video. What you say in secret is who you are.

@TheLastWord @MittRomney Than how, as President, the HEAD of the gov't, will Romney Create jobs, if Gov't Can't create jobs?

Mitt Romney trying to mainstream LDS religion by saying he was a pastor. LIAR! His church does not have pastors, only bishops 
Not a God question and Romney mentioned God and I kind of nailed it but it's so much worse. 
Romney that man didn't ask you about your damn religion. Answer the damn question. 
Why would Romney say 100% when Obama hasn't mentioned the 47%? I think I just saw a light bulb go on above Obama's head 
I Believe we are all Children of the Same God #Mitt Romney

@ThatWhiteBoyCJ Romney has given millions to charities, churches and schools also. 
If Romney was such a great governor, why do polls show Obama leading in Mass. by 19%? 
Romney says he'll level the playing field between China and US because its fairer. He can't use the same tactic in class inequality at home?

Romney said he would eliminate  Capitol Gains tax for middle class!  I find that very important and exciting! 
@nadine92 just checked 'em out. Glad to see a fair view.. Romney is simply inconsistent & a blatant liar 
Just sarcastically asked Gillie who she was voting for. @The_chris_ryan quickly informed me she was voting for Mutt Romney. Well Done.

Mitt Romney's view on Women is what makes me like Obama more. #ObamaAllTheWay

I don't think Romney did poorly. I just think the President used what was available to him -- all the weight and power of the Presidency. 
Obama pulled a "rope a dope" on Romney with the Libya comment! (confirmed?) #debates #HofstraDebate 
Obama get's a little aggressive and passionate and he's perceived as being angry but Romney is blatantly rude and it's nothing. OH. 
@Lis_Smith I agree Mrs smith. Romney will guarantee his major taxes will not go up but for us regular Americans he had no clear answers. 
God will lead us in the way we want. Not the President. So I would rather vote for a Christian in Obama than a Mormon in Romney. 
Romney Got Caught In So Many Lies..!

So I hear Mitt Romney won the debate? Or is that just Fox. 
@OhAlex_: honestly both candidates have their faults but Romney truly terrifies me 
Although would be fun watching Romney and The Donald kickn some china butt. #yaright 
First thing I read on debate, from Sullivan. God, the relief. "To my mind, Obama dominated Romney tonight in every single way." 
Stupid Romney ugh only cares about money and power 
This was a VERY testy debate. Romney played Biden card & interrupted frequently. Not sure it works when you're being rude to Pres though. 
I love the fact checkers after the debate when they PROVE that all that shit Romney talkin is just that bull fuckin shit! No facts No plan 
ppl be thinking that if Romney is our new president their gna have to be mormon? uh no! politics & religion are two different things. 
So happy that Pres Obama pointed out the irresponsible opportunistic act of Romney's statements on the Libyan attack prematurely #CSPAN2012 
Romney wanna kill welfare ... u kno how much of the USA is on welfare? 
@cspan #cspan2012. Romney won, BO improved over last time, but not enough. 
Honestly, how can anybody support Romney?  The guy is a liar and a tool. 
Romney must have realized the iphone his wife got for him was a fake. Hence his anger with China. 
So cbs also says people think Romney would create more jobs, but that Obama "cares more about them" haha

The president did EXCELLENT. I loved how he called out Romney on all his BS. Cindy was a great moderator but Republicans making excuses. 
@vangeloco Republicans are generally quieter than dems by nature. At the end, I said Obama won, but I don't think Romney did poorly. 
Mitt Romney should instead give some beauty tips because he does not look 65
