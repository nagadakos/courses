 @pattonoswalt  "This isn't so bad for Romney.  He can easily win this without single moms, immigrants, the middle class or all women" & LGBT 1885

 I wonder when Romney became a pastor, dt is preaching in a debate. looooool 1909
 Romney said so much bull crap I don't even remember what the question was. #PresidentialDebate2012 1910
 "ill get america working again" -Romney. Hmm well you also just said government does not create jobs. Makes total sense... 1912
 65000 jobs is a lot of jobs on a population of 16 million people... but I would think that Romney should create jobs in his own country 1914
 Romney: "I understand what it takes to make a bright and prosperous future. My passion flows from the fact that I believe in God." #debates 1915

 I can't stand seeing ignorant comments about Romney from black people that totally don't even make since #pleasestfu 1922
 seperation of church and state is clearly going out the window if Romney gets elected. and thats not okay 1923
 Cheap shot referencing the 47% remark when Romney doesn't get a chance to respond. #debates 1924
 47% for the win! Debate over. You lost this one Romney. 1925
 Did I just hear Mitt Romney accuse Chinese people of hacking our computers? 1926
 @DividendTitan Wrong, President has encourage US business, It is Romney who has the track record for outsourcing and hiding money offshore 1927
 Romney Is Just Avoiding Question & Creating False "Facts" 1929

 Win goes to Romney!!! 1936
 @littlekathzilla I honestly don't think Romney could do better. I don't even think he would try. He doesn't even care about minorities 1938
 Romney never used the word "victim" in his 48% remark. #debate 1941
 Romney was NOT talking about veterans, seniors, or truly disabled citizens.  He was talking about those on welfare that don't need it. #47% 1945
 Romney did incredibly well except for Libya (!?). Candy shouldn't have gotten into the semantics. Twitchy's fact check: http://t.co/3bosItAu 1947
 If Romney becomes president im moving to Italy 1948
 I'm at work missing the debate but from the looks of it Romney acting a fool I'm guessing... 1950
 Just realized I spent my 1,000th tweet bashing Mitt Romney. I'm cool with it 1952
 How embarrassing. Michelle Obama and Ann Romney wore the same dress. #debate 1954
 I don't know understand why Romney keeps saying that we are all under "the same God" are we really?I know some who won't agree with him! 1956
 I guess the main reason I don't like Romney is because I want religion out of politics 1957
 Romney won this debate! 1958
 Candy held Romney in check! 1959
 Was really hoping Romney would break out in song when asked to talk about who he really is. Maybe Beautiful by Christina Aguilera? 1961
 What about the 47%? Pure arithmetic means 53% only.. Romney doesn't care about 100% #debates 1963
 @Talkmaster and he was flat put lying. He know Romney wasn't talking about gi bills, SS and Medicare recipients. 1964
 Tonight's debate bound to hurt Romney with women voters & completely shoot down his hopes with single mothers. 1965
 Go home Romney!!!! 1966
 Too bad Romney didn't prep in Williamsburg. That debate could have been closer. 1968
 Romney is too secretive but no matter  who wins I'm gonna pray that the best person is selected!!! #GodControl 1969
 Who hasn't Romney offended yet?? 1970
 God, what a train wreck that was. Of course I believe Romney won; so many avoided answers from both sides though 1972

 I think Romney has lost the bird vote tonight #debate #debates 1977
 Romney is charging $5 an autograph !!! 1979

 CNN's John King just said Romney won the debate. #WiggaPlease 1982
 @michellemalkin no doubt Romney won big time! 1983

 I don't really care what you say, but #Romney is way better at this debating shit.#CantAfford4More #Debates 1990
 Romney can try again in 2016 1992
 Oop RT @JoyVBehar: Romney said he sat cross the table from people who lost their jobs. That's because he fired them#current2022 1993
 OBAMA WINS!!! Romney sounded like a broken record. Romney said the word jobs when the question was about cartoons. 1999
 If This Cracker Romney Win...I'm Moving To China...Imma Become The Next Karate Kid!!! 2000
 #debates Romney did Good even if hindered by 2 democrats, Crowly&Obama 2001
 @timvandenack Nah Romney has already clarified it. I guess if you are naive you might buy it. 2003
 #fact if Romney wins, Chicago will not have a presidential visit for atleast 4 years 2004
 I think after this debate even Romney supporters should question his character 2006
 @KatieCumlander Romney said he believed in God. I know, it shocked me too! 2011
 So what's Romney's stance on tanning tax? I think that may be the deciding factor of my vote. 2012
 @SophiaBush This isn't so bad for Romney.  He can easily win this without single moms, immigrants, the middle class or all women hahah 2015
 What if Romney wins. 2016
 If your going for Romney you obviously don't wanna go to college 2018

 "Romney offended literally every woman that I know." -my wife 2025
 Romney wins the second debate. 2026
 Danish TV is of the opinion, that Romney won this debate by a whisker #lolwut 2027
 Mitt Romney refers to Facebook as "lady binders." 2028
 I'm afraid Romney mentions God just to win over voters. And what's sad is that it's working. That can't be your reason to elect someone 2029
 That is so obvious to point who's lowkey racist when it comes to the people supporting Romney 2030
 @Money23Green Folks who says that must be voting for Romney cause he's white... 2031
 Why doesn't Mitt Romney just go live in Canada... 2032

 @Heminator Romney won the debate again.... 2041
 Did Mitt Romney say he cares about 100% of Americans? You 53% should be mad that idiot cant pick a side and stick to it! #FlipFlopper 2044
 @CarolineManzo I'd like Romney, just once, to be specific!   What exactly are the credits he plans to cuts to tax payers?   no answer 2045
 Haha I agree! The only thing Romney addressed with working women was making sure they get home to make dinner -___- lol #nobueno 2046
 If you're a woman voting for Romney, I have no respect for you since you obviously have no respect for yourself. 2048
 I'm in that 47% that Romney doesn't care about! 2052
 Romney working Fast and Furious into the commentary - despite getting slapped down by Crowley - was brilliant. @FoxNews #debate2012 2055
 To be real , theres WAY too much black people & wanna be black people for Romney to even think <-- of winning. 2056
 Romney seems to be a hot head redneck .... 2057
 this really proves how deep color is. bc if Romney is the only white option yet he does absolutely nothing for America, what are we doing? 2058
 all the reasons why Romney is a bad candidate have no political reasoning behind it....? #stop 2061
 Did anyone hear one single deduction Romney would close to pay for his ridiculous tax cut? #debate 2065
 I got bare reasons to not vote for Romney 2066

 Romney Isnt Gonna Win . 2072
 Are gay men included in the binders full of women, Romney? I'm not sure since you see neither as people. 2073
 O_o RT @msnbc: Romney somehow connects gun control to making sure people are married before they have kids. #msnbc2012 2074
 At the debate, Romney said he looked through "binders of women" to find female employees. That sounds like what I did with my last film... 2076
 Man Romney got all single mothers pissed right now 2077
 The debate was pretty even till the end. Then Romney hit a home run out of the park, while BHO continued to equivocate. @Lrihendry 2078
 Romney you're a lost soul my man. Stick to being a "priest!" 2080
 Pretty sure Romney lost all the single parents votes talkin that bullshit! I didnt get married first and joshua wont round shootin ppl!! 2083

 Romney needs a slap 2089
 Romney came for the illegal immigrants tonight....Welp he better know his stay in South Florida for the next debate will not be pleasant 2090
 If Romney is beating around anwsering the questions to give a solution! He's gone beat around getting the solution done! 2096
 I'm still very disturbed about Romney comments on immigration..These are ppl w/ dreams and skills..Pay attention he threw them 2 the wolves 2097
 @BillSpadea @ChasingNJ I think Romney will lose ground because he was riding a wave of 1st debate.  If that slows its a net loss. 2098
 Lol RT @Oh_Zee_Oh Only the top 2% of Americans should be voting for Romney!! That is all! 2101
 What is it with Romney and his love of Canada?  #MittLovesCanada #debates 2102

 @sethmeyers21 Does Romney get 3 pts for mentioning China??? I lost track. 2106
 @jordangauger Making money is huge!!! Romney has created more jobs in his companies than obama has in his 4 years as pres 2107

 Romney Was Red as Hell By the End of the Debate 2121
 The sad part about the election is if you live in TX or LA those electoral votes are most definitely going to Romney. smh 2127
 When are Americans going to stand up to the liberal media, moderators, staged  "undecided" voters? When we elect Romney on Nov. 6! #Debate 2129
 With apologies to Howard Cosell, "Romney goes down!" @Jimmyspolitics @billmaher #nbcpolitics 2131
 Are Romney supporters really circling their wagons right now? Come on. He not only lost. He was embarrassed. 2132
 @airjordanik23 yeah loved that the moderator wasn't a pushover this time and rattled Romney some. 2134
 Just glad Romney didn't wander around in the background like McCain did 4 years ago #debates 2137
 If that was to me you're stupid af this election is gonna make a small change in our life's and I'll tell why because if Romney wins he's 2138
 @billmaher HaHa! How 'bout 3 racist comments in 1 answer "what about food stamps" as Romney gestures towards the black man who asked 2139
 Watching the debate with the hubby, and i must say that Romney is very disrespectful. smh. 2143
 Krautjhammer is wrong, Romney won on points. 2144
 Still irked. Response to a question about equality for women in the workplace, Romney was proud he let a woman go home early to make dinner. 2145
 I dislike Romney. A lot. 2148
 I still believe Obama did bad the 1st debate purposely... To have better knowledge & feeling on Romney. âœŠ 2149
 Romney for sure would have fought AGAINST us during the women's right movement. And oh God the civil rights movement?? #Obama2012 2150
 2nd reason , Mitt Romney family owned slaves . 3rd he hasn't fully given a direct legit plan on how he would make changes. 2151

 @johnberman-- Fact Check - Romney gets "true, but misleading" (GREEN), POTUS gets, "False with exceptions" (RED)...#TeamBiteMeCNN 2158
 @ABC  I thought Romney was very rude to Candy. Is this how he will treat all women? 2159
 Crowley questions Romney math to his face. Did they clank audibly when she stood up? 2162
 Ladies, remember...Romney's idea of removing the glass ceiling is letting you leave early to get dinner ready #debate 2163
 My wife and daughter will NEVER be in your binder, #Romney. 2164
 @Xnives Oh Yeah, watched the whole thing...  Romney is a Liar, he's never to the point, and He's not going to make a good president. 2165
 @Hobokiller26 Romney used it as an example of spending cuts he would make to reduce federal budget 2166
 But during his political career, Romney has flip-flopped on whether he actually wanted to serve in Vietnam. 2167
 Looks like Romney won. #MERICA 2169
 @PoliticalTicker I refuse to take a 2$/hr job, as Romney would have it by magically bringing jobs back from China #CNNDebate. 2170
 @CBSNews Romney could have taken O to the mat with a knock out!! But he is a respectful gentleman &the country KNOWS the truth on Libya!! 2171
 How much do u want to bet that all my lovely Clemson belles except one, watched the debate, still don't understand and still, back Romney. 2172
 Sorry Romney but I was raised by my mom only....I apologize for being a success and defying your theories... 2173
 Job Done. Hopefully it will stop Romney's momentum. Unlikely to shift polls much though. 2175
 Oh god, "clashing protests" on Hempstead Tpke? That must have been uncomfortable for the Romney supporters. 2176
 Why does Mitt Romney keep citing studies after saying they aren't reliable in the first debate? #PDSLive 2177
 @Follow_Me_Ho3 BOL ! I Liked When Romney Interrupted Him And He Was Like "It's Okay, I'm Used To Gettin Interrupted . Romney Has No Manners" 2178
 Even then, we still can't deal with Romney!RT @AriesWeAre: #Aries don't deal with stupid people, unless we are in the mood for a little fun. 2181
 @SamFeistCNN but let me guess they loved Romney lie about 100% 2182
 Maybe Romney should go run him a business and leave our president to run this country.. 2183
 @markdewes But markets are global and the companies that Romney is fighting for support China's actions through their actions. 2185
 If Ann #Romney can't get Mitt to respect women and their reproductive rights he is indeed a lost cause. 2186
 That's cool that Romney's state is ranked first in education in a country ranked 31st, way to go bro #debates 2187
 Funniest part of the #debate was when Romney talked about the 'Binders Full of Women.' I would love to see these binders :-) 2189
 @speechboy71 Exactly. It could be Romney's worst debate at the worst possible time 2190
 @KarlRove not to mention  all of CC's interruptions of Romney and correcting him and directing BO how to answer. 2191
 @maumau_correa 1. How do you prosecute a state that's shouldering most of our national debt? 2. Romney's hypocritically invested in China. 2192
 I believe him. #Romney #debate2012 2195
 You all call people who are voting for Romney all these horrible things, but I can guarantee you they aren't. 2196
 I don't trust Mitt Romney tho. I genuinely feel he doesn't care a bit for anyone who isn't well-off enough to help further his own interests 2197
 @TVMoJoe I believe Romney was saying that the Pres. was out apologizing for an unrelated issue & not discussing what really happened. 2199
 Romney-bot suffered a partial break down resulting in him not going to shake hands with the crowd. After a few repairs, he was functional. 2200
 "I knew a poor person once. Being poor is bad." -Romney #cspan2012 #obama2012 2201

 Okay to the immigrants & women complaining about Romney, my mother is both, and is very successful. Go get a job and stfu. 2203
 @michellemalkin  Mitt Romney won given it's 2 against 1.  Why do these moderators think they have to help O? 2204
 By Oprah, so Romney knows how to handle money. 2206
 Romney is brilliant at taking a hard question and stepping around the answer with a complicated word salad. 2208
 I feel that Mittens Romney is not only a liar, but he is very rude. i was appalled that he specifically told the moderator "no" 2210
 "I hired a woman once." -- Mitt Romney, Paragon of Feminism and equality. 2212
 Everytime Romney lies take a shot! #GTV Have poison control on speed dial deaux lol 2213
 Who thought Romney won? 2216
 Hi I'm Romney... I would rather argue than actually answer a question. And that will be the last I will try to speak of this election. 2219
 Take a drink every time Romney says the middle class has been buried? - #DrinkingGame http://t.co/Qd8lZ40V 2220
 My favorite part of the debates is the fact checkers bringing down the D hammer on Romney. 2221
 @BretBaier @foxnews @megynkelly good job! Tough debate but good show for Romney! 2222
 Unless your family is making 250,000 a year, you're not middle class to Romney and he's not going to help you. 2227
 Why is everybody like "Romney better not be president!" i mean he is obviously not gunna win... -_- 2230

 If Romney just wants to just use effective tax rates w/ no deductions than say that #PDSLive #youtubepolitics 2232
 Just realized that both, did not answer major questions - Romney, on how the math in his tax plan makes sense. #POTUS on the Libya incident. 2238
 John Kerry calling Romney inconsistent. LOL. 2241
 You can look at Romney face during the debate...that "little fella" was shooked! No little boys in a Big Boy's game kid! #BarackObama2012 2244
 Actually Romney did do bad at all tonight. All that he did was say what he needed to say, and he said it clearly. #ClearlyTheWinner 2245
 @edshow Romney's disrespect to Candy shows how he bullies women 2246
 Romney: I will create more jobs, I know how, I will do it. Student: Okay, how?Romney: I will create the jobs. Student: -______- 2247
 John Kerry: Mitt Romney keeps changing.... You just can't trust this guy. 2248
 I heard that Romney was a morman? Dont know if thats true, but I know some other Mormans and their no different, and they are really nice. 2249
 When his turn came on the Libya question, why didn't Romney just say "Mr. President, answer the question?  Who denied the add'l protection?" 2250
 I think Romney DOES care about the 47%...he cares that they've now heard his conversation. XD 2251
 Romney loves to say he ran & balanced the budget of the Olympics, Romney got most of that $$ from the federal govt. #biggovtgettingthing ... 2252

 @orangeinah Still think I'm voting for Romney now. 2267
 Keep in mind before these debates started I wasn't too enthused with Romney. Also keep in mind they've been talking economy. 2268
 @Foster_Vann you sound like Romney? Atleast Romney talks in the debates 2269
 Lol the Republicans know Romney is #Losing but they're trying to be optimistic saying Romney did a good job 2272

 @joerogan I think Romney is better because he's basically a used car salesman to me. 2281
 #Romney labels China a "currency manipulator" - I would not bite the hand that feeds you. Great policy 2282
 @neo99934 @MittRomney @BarackObama Mitt Romney Just became PRESIDENT tonight! 2283
 A vast majority of Americans exploit social welfare. While I'm no Romney fan.. There is some truth to th 47%. 2284
 Sorry, Candy Crowley, that Romney was so rude to you. #TeamBarack #presidentialdebate #MittLies #debate2012 2287
 .@John_Ondo Bc I thought it was a draw. Have my rundown on my TL. Didn't think Romney did as well as the undecideds seem to. Great news! 2289
 @Gibson_2012 But if you are voting for Romney, what you supposedly are going to get are "lowered taxes." 2291
 My main problem w/ Romney is his plan to make all the illegals leave. Who is going to make all the tacos??? #FlawedPlan #Debates 2293
 Who do you think won the debate?Romney or Obama? 2294
 Romney clearly won that. Cant wait til this country is up and running again. #presidentRomney 2295
 Watched the debate for 5 minutes. Turned the station because Romney is annoying. I don't like either of them #voteforDonald #PresidentTrump 2296
 Not unexpected, though: panel said they were torn between Romney and not voting. Undecideds! 2299
 @timothy_stanley - Don't you think that was Romney's weakest point in the debate.  Romney should probably avoid all foreign policy to win. 2303
 @BretBaier Very surprised by the Hannity focus groups reactions, they were as adamant tonight that Romney won as they were last debate. 2304
 There is a big difference between living/going thru something and having others tell u about it.  Romney has no clue!! 2305
 @gretawire Romney won, he made his case, he is the next president of the USA! 2306
 Romney should be president. 2307
 Mitt Romney could not put Candy Crowley in a binder. Ha! #debate #debate2 2312
 Romney just sounds so much nicer when he talks. 2313
 Romney lost bad 2315
 Romney no where NEAR won the debate. He couldn't even answer one question with a straight answer. 2317
 If your voting because of race, remember that Abraham Lincoln was a Republican, and Mitt Romney's family Marched for Civil Rights. 2319
 CSPAN caller: "I noticed how much of a flippity-jibbit Romney was being." 2320
 @finneyk Romney had a female Lieutenant Gov and more females on staff than any other governor. Your argument doesn't hold water. Or truth. 2321
 Romney is terrible on stage, just like Senator Marco Rubio from Florida. 2322
 Kanye West should've came & interrupted Romney in the debate. 2323
 I don't know about equal pay.Romney  went through binders full of women as if qualified women are so hard to find! Romney=Wrong for women 2325
 Go Romney! Lets get the economy going again and get people to spend money! 2328
 I don't like Mitt Romney's platform or his speeches, this debate is over. 2329
 I just don't know Romney says he is going to do this and that but actually how what's your plan man give us a layout at less #TeamBarack 2331
 @MelissaNagy1 @StephieT_31 yup i can believe it. Romney is a evil prick. Like the time he walked a blind professor into a door on purpose. 2333
 @IngrahamAngle Romney was thrown off balance on Libya by Crowley interjecting a debatable point as fact#shameless 2335

 "I appreciate windjobs in Iowa," stands as the raunchiest thing Mitt Romney has ever said. #Debate 2338
 @cnnbrk Romney said undocumented people born/living in USA can serve in the military or gov. will make their life so difficult they'll leave 2341
 Romney said the government doesn't create jobs. Why is he talking about all the jobs he can create? #TeamBarack #debate 2342
 @maddow: At least Romney would get us women home in time to get in the kitchen and cook dinner #oldfashionedmanthink 2343
 Sure the Romney people won't cry over spilled milk...that's what we are here for! @crowleycnn #cnn 2345
 @MagandaAkoAy so is there anything wrong being told that? People voting for Romney have the right to vote for whoever they want, right? 2347
 @gretawire Loved Romney!  Proud of Romney for standing up to the lies. You go dude! http://t.co/TfRnCtdv 2348
 Tonight's description of Romney- Snooty, elite, disrespectful, entitled, cheesy, wrong, insincere, distant, aloof, exposed and dishonest. 2349
 @dwas_0305 their feet & Romney being a "good man of God" should understand that & help those people too instead of try to take away things 2353
 Mitt Romney's lies are not the biggest problem, it is our inability to listen to his truth. 2354
 @joshtpm Candy did great too many times Romney get's away with lying to the nation about time he was called out with un-disputable evidence 2358
 @AndreaTantaros Wish Romney pursued those areas more vigorously. Candy's bias didn't help either. 2359
 I'll be honest, the only tidbit I've learned about either candidate is that Romney is a huge fan of The Killers. Now that's interesting. 2361
 "Very little of what governor Romney just said is true" #themeofthedebate 2365
 Romney stated government cannot create jobs then in the same sentence he promised to creat 12 million jobs...LMBO!!! #Idiot 2368
 Know your facts Mr. Romney before you bully "No acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great nation" http://t.co/m9x7FKiO 2370
 "We just can't afford four more years like the past four years." -Romney #RomneyRyan2012 2371
 Rachel Maddow is reporting that Republicans fled the post debate spin room...They went biblical on "fled " Romney did too! #maddow 2372
 @AndreaTantaros.  Don't you think it would help Romney if he would say I'm not for abortion being used as birth control. 2373
 Without the mainstream media, Romney would have been ahead long before the debates. 2377
 Romney rules end of storyy 2378
 God is in control of everything!  I thank Him for the platform He has given me!  I respect everybody's opinion but Romney 2012!! #Godis1st 2379
 & #Romney said NO Taxcuts 4 Rich, just 4 middle-class. Again, unlike what he's on the record saying he'd do! 20% tax cuts 4 All,NOTpossible! 2380
 How much R Koch Bros.  Adelson & ?? paying Romney & Ryan 2 destroy middle class?Could they help homeless with that money... Why not? 2383
 Romney be LYINGGGGGGGG!!!!! 2384
 Romney Says he'll crack down on China and stop migrating manufacturing jobs to China! Really? America is made in China!!! 2386
 @IngrahamAngle Yes, Romney blew that opening. Damn. 2389

 @DickMorrisTweet Romney on his common sense approach to the  economy and reduction in government. 3125
 @EWErickson @SamFeistCNN Romney lied on all the key issues. When are Republicans going to stop the charade & realize that this is REAL life 3126
 @gretawire Romney won by far. The government lost on his rhetoric. 3127
 @lordlabak I wish Romney wins...but I doubt that would happen 3128
 @Mac_Nasty7 Romney has the skills to fix the economy. That's the most important thing to me right now. 3129
 @Martin_Flood maybe you are right. I fear for the world if Romney wins. Then again..maybe he would be different in office. 3130
 @morningmika @JoeNBC #Romney doesn't function consistently 3131

 Romney is a communist. 3145
 Romney is the best at vague promises. #debate #debates #diabetes #typo 3146
 Romney justified  paying women less because his female Chief of Staff had to be home by 7 to cook clean and do the laundry. 3147
 Romney Looked Like A Fool Last Night And A Liar 3148
 Romney seems like the perfect presidential candidate, until he speaks.  #47% 3149
 Romney think we all can just go ask our parents for 30k for college. Not everyone was born rich like you 3150
 Romney you have no business Running for President! You are a Complete Charlatan ! 3151
 Romney, Stop Lying! You don't care about me, your plans have shown me that you don't give a damn about me or people that look like me 3152
 Romney...you can't continue to say that something will work because it  worked in Massachusetts. That state makes up 2% of the population. 3153
 Romney's first major victory occurred on June 6th 1944 where he single handedly claimed the beach of Normandy. 3154
 Romney's five-point plan is a one point plan. Like about everything. 3155
 After watching the debate I was disappointed,I thought Romney would  explain more of his agenda,like McCain in 08,acted like he was on uppers 3156
 all i hear is  lies from Romney #pleasestop 3157
 As my grandma would say, #Romney is more full of shit than a Christmas turkey. I'd like to suggest a few locations to store his #BINDERS. 3158
 Can someone make a joke about how Romney *would* put women in a bind? I can't be bothered. 3160
 Dear Mitt Romney: please forward those binders of women along when you get a chance. Thanks much! 3161
 Didn't your mother teach you it was rude to interrupt, and point your finger in peoples faces Mr. Romney #Rudeashell 3162
 Dude, Romney/Ryan, I respect you, but damn, you're not what we need. A shift in political authority is not ideal at this moment. #Paradigm 3163
 During the debate, Romney just repeated himself, changed positions when it was convenient 3164
 every time I see Mitt Romney, all I can think of is Mitt and His Magic Pants. #pusamaterial 3165
 For some reason my tweets were sent today...whatever...Romney is the man that will  lead America and bring jobs back 3166
 Good morning everyone, I hope you have your BINDERS today,like Romney and his binders of women. 3168
 Gov. Romney looked strong on the economy tonight. Also acted more Presidential. I'm looking forward to his leadership for the next 4 years! 3169
 Hahahaha did Romney really just say he caresabout 100% of the American people!? #bullshit #47Percent #youdontgiveashitaboutus 3170
 Honestly I do agree with Romney on the  unwed parents. It too kids having kids now in days. Too mutts, smuts, and nuts running round. 3171
 How can you support Romney when he is so  anti-women's rights? 3172
 I bet Obama has a #binderfullofwomen Romney certainly isnt the only one to have one! 3173
 I feel like if Romney win he gone abuse his authority 3174
 I guess I'm not in the top rich 1% because i don't have #bindersfullofwomen. I'll work hard in the next life to have Romney s binder 3175
 I prefer Romney though. Obama was talking things he had no idea about. How can you be talking about budgets based on what 'advisers' say? 3176
 I wonder why it's hard to take Romney seriously when he opposes outsourcing... #HofstraDebate #debates 3177
 If Romney is elected, I will finally be able to make it home at a reasonable hour to feed my husband and children a proper dinner. 3178
 If women are moving to Romney it could be due to churches pressuring votes on social issues. #p2 #justsayin 3179
 If you jus look into Romney and Ryan's eyes, they look pure evil 3180
 If your a girl and have had sex, don't vote for Romney because he is taking away all forms of birth control! You will become pregnant!#tards 3181
 If you're voting for Romney because you believe in  Hope & Change, you're an idiot. 3182
 I'll vote for Romney if he  takes away tanning taxes. #tanningprobs 3183
 In 1965, Mitt Romney was arrested for using large blocks of ice to slide down the slopes of a golf course. 3185
 Just woke from a nightmare where Mitt Romney was trying to make me lie and say he's a good guy. He's the Freddy Krueger of douche-baggery! 3186
 Krauthammer on Fox: When Romney went large, he did well.  Libya is a huge opening that Romney missed. 3187

 Mitt Romney's stupid for bringing up that 47% video, smh. #HofstraDebate Anyway... 3194
 My 17 year old son was fact checking Mitt Romney during the debate last night. Mitt definitely kept him busy. 3195
 My great objection to #Romney is his mistake belief that insurance is the only way to fund health care & we must be forced to buy insurance. 3196
 Not only that. But Mitt Romney is comfortable with disrespecting the president. The president is still the president. 3197
 One thing is clear, Mitt Romney prefers binders full of women more than binders full of facts. 3198
 So after have followed the 2nd #debate I would want Mr. Mitt Romney to win the presidential elections !#debate2012 #President #Romney 3199
 The only thing Obama could beat Romney at is  golf. 3200
 The truth finally comes out on Romney's  lies#2012Debate 3201
 There is also a videotape of Romney saying how he plans to do nothing and by doing that the economy will better itself.   What an idiot. 3202
 Voting for Romney as a female student shows your true ignorance to what's going on. 3203
 When Mitt Romney is president, I hope one of the first things he does is pass a law preventing Hollywood from making any more shitty movies. 3204
Women complain about everything. Even when allowed by Romney to go home early to cook dinner and get kids ready. Ingrates. 3205
 Really, the only things I don't like about Romney is his view on gay rights and Planned Parenthood</>. 3206
 When I look at Romney I just see a mormon loool 3207
 @GMA  Romney won 3208
 Romney was petulant and characteristically misleading -   John Kerry on @Morningjoe 3209
 @joetumbarello @jo_epp Romney doesn't want to help the middle class he's a rich scumbag who wants to help the upper class 3210

 @markknoller Romney was too aggressive - disrespectful and basically a jerk.  A million miles from presidential. 3218

 @cnnbrk: #CNNpoll: Governer Romney was kinda Rude! 3220

 Am I the only one who thinks Mitt Romney looks a bit like Will Ferrell? 3222
 you think Mitt Romney checks his mentions? 3223
 FACT: There were NO women partners at Bain Capital during Romney's time #bindersfullofwomen #Phoney #MorningJoe 3225
 On a political note, after the debate, would people still root for Romney? I sure hope not. 3227
 Mitt Romney makes me mad, when he was talking about jobs, but never explained how! Its like he's saying: "I will get you all a job" . . df. 3228
 Sitting in @Starbucks wearing my Romney/Ryan shirt & I'm the only person that hasn't been offered a free drink from the Verismo System. 3229
 @DRUDGE_REPORT  Mitt Romney is a relentless, bald-faced liar, a sociopath, a thing without a conscious: the devil. 3230
 "Gov. Romney doesn't have a 5-point plan. He has a 1-point plan... to make sure that folks at the top play by a different set of rules." 3231
 Mitt Romney is nothing more than a snake oil salesman peddling his bullshit to a Fox bubble head mentality! 3232
 @STARANDBUCWILD You voting for Romney cause you must have them investments in China. 3233
 Ready for the election to be over. I don't need anymore time to come to the conclusion that Romney is ridiculous. 3234
 I'm convinced that 99% of Romney voters are voting for him because he's white. 3235
 Only reason i'd support #Romney is because we both got binders full of bitches. Hahahaha. #notreally 3236
 - Mitt Romney's campaign is $25 million in debt. This is the guy that's gonna fix our economy? 3237
 @nahjaaa dead ass Romney going to be the end of America 3238
 Romney, if elected, will single-handedly create more enemies for the U.S. than BOTH presidents named Bush. 3239
 Stop picking on Romney for his #BindersFullofWomen comment. Having binders full of women is an important tenant of the Mormon faith. 3240
 @crowleyCNN Shame on you. You owe Mitt Romney and apology and explanation! 3241
 Heres the thing about Romney: everything he said about women that we're all laughing about, he says those things because he has nothing else 3242
 @LupeFiasco what are your thoughts on Mitt Romney? #ImCanadian 3243
 "@FlawlessDelena: Ladies. Romney hates trees and women. Ian Somerhalder." 3245
 How can people even consider Voting for a LIAR like Romney? I'm not even sure he knows the difference anymore #questions #OTVB 3246
 Romney has my vote if he would make #bindersfullofwomen jokes through the day today on twitter himself. Lets laugh so we don't cry 3247
 Debate: Romney was as good as 1st Debate 3248
 Mitt Romney's behaviour in discussion is horrible :( 3251
 @mantone1 All points Romney should have made. 3253
 I woke up to so many Romney jokes from last nights debate. Lets leave this rich fortunate blessed white man alone. 3254
 @BretBaier Last night's debate sure did not change my mind. Proud of Gov. Romney!!! 3256
 I wanna puke everytime I look at Mitt Romney's face 3257
 Romney's Tax plan still sounds like magic. 3260

 Romney's wife looks evil and creepy... 3262
 @Lindolini @vasuvasu Mitt Romney? That's a person's real name? 3263

 @bgardner Mitt Romney's house? 3265

 Vote for Romney #TerribleAdvice 3271
 @MarkHalperin Nothing brilliant about Romney last night  #bindersfullofwomen 3272
 After watching the debate I can honestly say that Mitt Romney is a fucking idiot. 3274
 @JansingCo Romney IS rude AND a bully.I thought he was going2jump on Candy.No comparison&yes I am a woman&he deeply offends me 3275
 This girl onside of me in my math classIs voting for Romney ! 3278
 Mitt Romney is an actual joke, he contradicts himself every debate 3279
 @MattBatzel Romney got schooled last night!  Romney was so disrespectful.  Loved when Crowley called Mitt out on one of his MANY lies 3281
 @TheFix I feel the same way about Romney lies, but after all we are talking about the media doing their jobs. #AintGonnaHappen 3282
 This girl in my class said it was okay for Romney to lie because that's how you win an election and she is still voting for him -___- #Wtf 3283
 I am going to vote for Romney. 3284
 After watching the full debate las night, i didnt think Romney did as bad as people been claiming. Theres def a huge bias on internet media. 3286
 Mitt Romney saved the Olympics WITH FEDERAL FUNDS 3287
 @scottRcrawford @guardian Sorry, but any man who calls himself a feminist deserves ridicule. Romney's only moderately more ridiculous. 3289
 #masdirin LOOK: Is Mitt Romney Stretching His Father's Mexican Connection For Votes? #news 3290
 If any female is voting for Romney you're an idiot... He's telling us we have no control over our body 3293
 Mitt Romney is a misogynist and his 18th century views on women make me sick. Any woman voting for him is in denial or has no self respect. 3294
 Mitt Romney has a "book filled with qualified women"... I think they call this a black book.  :) 3295
 Mitt Romney will create tons of jobs for women. Mother, wife, cook, maid, boo-boo kisser, sex-bot, etc. 3296
 Romney told 31 "myths" in 41 minutes - in other words, he lied 31 times. 3297
 Romney can't pronounce "legislation" and it annoys me. 3298
 @alexwagner Would love to hear how women feel about Mr. Romney's answer to the equal pay question. (Not male talking heads) 3299
 I wanna be Mitt Romney for Halloween. I feel like that's the scariest costume out there. 3300
 Wanna hear a joke? Mitt Romney. 3302
 @thehill Romney has no clue what we want. He is #binderfullofemptypages #debate #MittLies 3303
 @aravosis I think the binders comment reflects Romney's arrogance & self-centeredness: if it was done, obviously he must have thought of it. 3304
 Romney competent, assured, informed, steady. 3305
 "@blackenterprise: It's important to note Romney's answer on immigration tonight greatly differs from his answer during the primary #debate" 3306
 So when I die, bury me next to 2 binders full of women.- Mitt "2 Chainz" Romney 3309
 "what was Mitt Romney's big gaffe last night?" showing up? 3310
 how is Governor Romney suppose to crack down on China trade? 3311
 I'm so jealous of Romney, he has binders of woman, and I have to settle for folders :( 3312
 I wish someone had asked this last night: If the government cannot create jobs, why does Romney think he can create 12 million? #debate2012 3313
 @Gramzy7 Romney was so perfect on pointing out these facts. 3314
 A much better dig on Romney would be to point out that his response to equal pay was the gender equivalent to "Hey, I have black friends" 3315
 Romney do not know the true meaning of "middle class", "poor", "struggle" etc 3316
 I think that Romney showed how he doesn't respect normal (middle class) people by just putting up his hand and talks about what he wants! 3317
 It's national Ass day?... I think Mit Romney needs to get his contexts right. 3319
 On women's issues, Romney doesn't just talk the talk, he walks the walk. Just ask women who have worked for and with him. 3320
 Reading highlights of the US presidential debate, it's apparent one should wear a helmet while reading anything said by Romney. #facepalm 3321
 @FINALLEVEL When I watched Romney talk last night all I could hear in my head was @MrChuckD singing "He talking loud, ain't saying nothing" 3322
 @murielpaul8 @BeltwayBaca @MittRomney keep fighting for the american people thank you Romney 3323
 Romney is in. Now, he needs a Senate to  repeal the healthcare law, and to implement a sane tax policy. Focus on the Senate. 3324
 @DebtTrut no problem : ). I think we both r disgusted with Romney's bominable behavior. He is one mean guy who feels entitled to NO RULES! 3325
 Mr. #Romney, #Mexicans / #Latinos should not be referred to as #illegals. They are people with have #families just like you. #immigration 3327
 And he crushed the president on who would do a better job handling our deficit. Voters chose Romney on the issue by a margin of 59% to 36%. 3328
 Did Romney get those Lady Binders at Staples? 3329
 Mitt Romney looks like one of the muppets. 3330
 "Mitt Romney" needed to hire a recruiter to find the #bindersfullofwomen .Trapped In The Closet #gll GoDs Laughing Loudly 3331
 @kimguilfoyle Dont let bob get away w lie about Bengazy. Romney looked Presidental and won since he had the TRUTH and facts. 3332
 @realDonaldTrump Romney is just like you,criticisms but no solutions.You both treat running a business as If you were running a Country. 3333
 I'm rather angry about a lot of things this morning, and I can blame it squarely on Mitt Romney and Phil Ginsberg. 3334
 It's time for us to cut back on government and help the American People. -Mitt Romney June 8,2012 in Iowa 3335
 #Romney confirmed the stereotype, while floundering to explain how he wants to help women. 3336
 If Romney goes into office we might as well go back to being slaves in society. 3337
 @jtoy30 @dspoon2 I'm voting Romney cause he getting rid of birth control so I can finally be a baby daddy 3338
 @sydbrownstone: 10 bucks says next year there will be a #cmj band playing @cakeshopnyc called Romney's Binder. the next Sleater Kinney 3339
 Monica: "If we took out all the oil from Romney's hair last night the US could be energy independent." #Debate2012 #GObama 3341
 Reporters: 'Phase' is only rarely used as a verb. Romney was not phased by the questions last night. He was 'fazed' = disconcerted. 3342
 Mitt Romney is the Jame Gumb of politics: IT PUTS THE WOMAN IN THE BINDER, OR ELSE IT GETS THE NO EQUAL PAY HOSE. 3344
 @joebakes20 you walk like Romney 3345
 Romney seems like the kind of guy who still makes "women in the kitchen making sandwiches" jokes. 3347
 Romney obviously doesn't even watch the news, even during an election, so he didn't know what the Pres said the day after Benghazi! 3348
 Romney will magically become conservative and stop supporting what he has for decades if he wins. #LoL 3349
 Romney is full of horse shit. 3350
 @ladyblue49 I tweeted in the morning, and your night during debate using #Venuspeak if you read, I can prove Romney is weak in Math :-) 3351
 Every minute Romney and Ryan spend talking about Libya is time not spent talking about the economy. 3352
 @callumborchers joins us today for a debate fact-check of issues from Romney's time as Governor to see if the claims from both sides add up. 3353
 @kf4yfa - I saw some of the replays and was so proud of Romney for standing his ground - I love it when a man stands up for his beliefs!! 3354
 Watching that presidential debate again gave me a better understanding on why I dislike #Romney...I 3356
 #HistoricGhettoMoments #Romney'sjobplan: Employers make the rules and employees get screwed 3357
 There is NO presidential election story more newsworthy today than new #Gallup poll showing Romney up nationally 51-45. #election2012 3358
 @navarrotells When interrupted, you expect Romney to act like Obama did in the first debate? The moderator stepped out of line 3359
 @MartinBashir Of course Romney looked for women to work for him. He could pay them less and keep his payroll down. 3360
 Romney why you so damn dumb, I mean look at the decisions you want to make, We might as well jump our asses back to the 1800's ! -____- 3361
 Mitt Romney scored last night on both substance and style. 3363
 Mitt Romney disgusts me. He's so rude, and idiotic. I pray he isn't our future president. 3364
 And on the other side please explain to me why Romney would be a good president. Because I don't see anything that appeals to me at all. 3365
 What Planet  does Mitt Romney live on? Does He really think cutting taxes for the wealthy will create Job growth? is he a Mormon or a MORON? 3366
 USA would be in serious trouble if we somehow voted Romney into office. He is so short sighted just like most americans 3367
 Mum mentioned Mitt Romney earlier, I don't think I've hated someone has much as him, just knowing that he's breathing annoys me. #Angry 3368
 @ElfandSlater Listen to the rose garden speech before you say Romney was corrected. He never called the Benghazi attack an act of terror. 3369
 Romney balanced the Olympics budget with $1B in government funding and donated labor by union workers. #Forward2012 3370
 Look on the bright side, if Romney wins, maybe he'll start keeping his money in our banks. 3371
 Let me get political here Mr.Romney u can't bring the #fuel prices down but your rich ass homies could 3372
 The moderator had to interrupt Romney so much because he wouldn't follow the format of the debate. 3373
 @Dominic_Calvano True! At least Romney kept the lying to a minimal, didn't top his 27 lie record in the first debate. 3374
 If there's one thing I learned from Mitt Romney, it's that I need to store all my women in binders. Gotta tidy up around here. 3375
 Maybe if Governor Romney watched more Sesame Street his math would be better. 3376
 Romney looks like he lies to people to get more money 3378
 Can't wait to hear #Romney stumble through the foreign policy part of the debate next Monday. 3379
 That creepy smirk that Romney's always got plastered on his face seriously creeps me out... 3380
 @michellemalkin I think we need some 'Women for Romney' tee shirts made! #election 2012! 3381
 @GOP @Reince Romney has a plan to strengthen all of America. He has stated it time again. I don't know how any one is missing it. 3382
 Romney's 5 point plan: 1. Eliminate 2. You 3. Broke 4. Ass 5. Niggas 3383
 @jbarro  Though insistent that government can't create jobs, Romney promises to create 12 million jobs as president 3384
 Do you think that people should continue to receive Government Assistance if Romney is elected? Please let me know your thoughts on this. 3385
 #Romney Debate = Condescending, Boorish, Petchulant, Insincere, Defensive, Aggressive, Out of Touch, Disrespectful.  #Debate #tlot #tcot 3386
 Binder Full of Women, Plan Full of Holes - the new book by Mitt Romney 3387
 Dear Mitt Romney: "Illegal" is not a noun. Stop dehumanizing people! 3388
 .@Pudingtane Just imagine what Romney could have accomplished in those 3 1/2 minutes. 3389
 Romney was that one kid in class that asked why can't we just print more money 3390
 Romney: i will fix this issue by fixing this issue that is my plan 3391
 If Romney gets elected I won't feel obligated to pay taxes anymore :D 3393
 #IfIWasPresident Romney would be shipped to africa 3394
 I am shocked that there haven't been more Romney/BoM jokes. Come on guys! He's practically HANDING them to you! 3396
 Under Romney, Massachusetts was 47th in job creation. 3397
 To be fair, "Binders full of Women" is a pretty weak gaffe to be harping on.  Plenty more substantive reasons not to vote for Romney. 3398
 Remember: Romney's Mormonism admonishes women only to work until she has children. Then quit work, stay home to raise them #p2 #tcot #ocra 3399
 @djoddsox You do realize that Romney's plan is on his site, right? 3400
 Romney is so good that he could sell shaving cream to the Taliban. 3401
 Mitt Romney might win the erection and that scares me #foxnews 3402
 @MadcapAnthony If you can't see Romney's success, then you don't want to see it. You will never see it. 3403
 Romney really needs to stop mentioning birds and death together in any way shape or form. It's not helping him. 3405
 @notaxation Because of that mans actions and comments I will definitely vote Romney...some people... 3406
 I'd just like to point out that Romney wears more hairspray than most girls 3407
 Romney is a "PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE" NOT the PRESIDENT, & since all he does is point fingers at the Current he won't be the next 3408

 'Government does not create jobs.' True Romney, true. 3422
 Yes Romney please be specific! 3423
 Government doesn't create jobs but Romney sure took them away.. #pow 3424
 "Government does not create jobs."  Isn't that what you're promising Americans, Gov. Romney?  #debates 3425
 @NJohnston_45 HOW IS HE GONNA CUT IT if he has only 4 years!! Romney will make it 5356 times worse 3426
 Romney is pissing off my mom right now . Everytime he mentions china she rolls her eyes and calls him an idiot Lol 3427
 Romney needs to stop trashing China. Of they cut us off then were SCREWED! 3428
 Why can't Romney EVER stay on topic.!! 3429
 @edshow #debates Romney: government does NOT CREATE JOBS.  Romney running for government. Romney wanting to create jobs???? uhhhhhhh 3430
 "Government does not create jobs" -Romney WTF?! What the heck has Romney been promising this whole campaign!? JOBS! So he's lying again! 3431
 Romney don't care about me...Lyin ass 3432
 @alexwagner Romney just said Government doesnt create jobs. Then how is he gonna create jobs as President? 3434
 "Some campaigns are more focused on attacking a person than stating what they prescribe" REALLY Romney... you did that this entire debate! 3435
 Strong debate by Romney again. Love it 3436
 @DatB0iAlex Romney believes in god 3438
 Romney has so many things to brag about himself. I wish he was more comfortable doing it. 3439
 Did he just say he was a pastor? #Romney. 3440
 Romney brings up the 47% elephant in the room by talking about his passion for the 100% of Americans #debate 3441
 Romney doesn't care about America. You will not get my vote #assholeRomney 3442
 Excuse Romney, he talks in the third person sometimes. #debate 3443
 Now that Romney's talking about what we don't have to settle for... do we still have to settle for a third round of this? #debate2012 3444
 Romney and Obama did not shake after the debate. 3445
 Romney really is a dumb ass. He doesn't even want to listen to the president which means he won't listen to the idiots who vote for him. 3446
 Romney always having a family reunion on stage !!! 3448
 @iamashleymoran I think Romney is doin great 3449
 #Romney: "I know what it takes to create jobs".  Really?  Then why did you kill so many by bankrupting companies Bain purchased? 3452
 Romney is planning to cut Pell Grants. So if you're in college and you vote for him. YOU'RE STUPID 3453
 No one wants Romney's signature 3454
 #nbcpolitics Romney should have done more research on his Libya remark. 3455
 I mean after that Libya question how can u believe anything Mitt Romney promises? 3457
 If Romney is elected I'm moving to Canada. #PeaceOut 3458
 #Romney is still in prep-school #latism 3459
 Romney mad as shit looking like a dirty lizard. He thought he was gonna win this debate 3460
 It's to the point where if u vote for Romney, ur voting for a liar that's uncertain of even his OWN word. 3461
 @Salon_Politics Romney is 100% right. The mention of acts of terror was a general, generic mention. It was not specific to Libya. 3462
 Y'all. They are saying this is a strong debate for Romney. 3463
 This debate wasn't as much of a blood bath as the last pres. Debate but definitely a big victory for Romney 3464
 I just don't understand how Romney's against single parents and also against abortions, especially for those who've been raped. #logic 3466
 Romney sealed the deal tonight Great Job 3467
 I'm still shocked @ Romney connecting gun violence to single parents. 3468
 I will freak out if Romney wins the election 3469
 Romney is just trying to sugar coat things ! Like NO , just shut up !!! 3470
 Summary of Debate: "I can create jobs if you make me the head of government, which cannot make jobs." - Mitt Romney #debates 3471
 Romney is all for the Rich. 3472
 Mitt Romney don't know what section 8 is so how he gone expect to help the middle class 3474
 @jeremyjojola Romney needs to respect moderators a little more. 3475
 Most disturbing comment by Romney: that women in particular need "flexible work schedules." Must say, I am personally insulted. 3477
 The only good thing about Romney is that his sons are good looking. 3478
 @nytimes If Mitt Romney is elected, and he will be, 100% of us will prosper because we will have jobs!!!!! 3479
 Governor Romney had data, he just doesn't have the proper solutions. 3481
 Romney is officially unqualified for the job. If you don't think so, please don't vote. 3483
 Mitt Romney IS A JOKE 3484
 Mitt Romney says government doesn't create jobs - why does he keep saying he'll create 12 million jobs?? 3485
 I'm about to switch to Fox to hear how Romney did amazingly. 3486
 Romney has some explaining to do on the outsourcing of US jobs.... #Bain made him a millionaire. 3487
 God help this Country if Romney is  elected president 3488
 NONONO Romney just mentioned a god in the debate, that's never never never a good idea. Don't alienate people like that. 3489
 In 2011 Romney gave over 19% of his income to charity. 3490
no one wants to take pictures with ann Romney... because she is ugly. 3491
 Bush and Romney are two totally different people.. Yes they are both republican that's it! Romney will make a difference! #truth 3492
 @zachelias96 @maxcreynolds Idk wht percentages everyone should pay..I just know a bit about economics. But I think Romney is the best option 3494
 muthafuckas are voting for Romney just because hes a Republican and they claim to be Republican. 3495
 Romney's definition of workplace equity for women was letting them go home early enough to cook dinner. What an awful answer!! 3496
 @lovelyAirikahxX exactly. Romney would probably just mess it all up. 3497
 What?! Now Romney wants women to get home from work sooner so they can make dinner? Boys can learn to cook too, ya know! 3498
 For the record: I do not believe Romney could have stopped the attacks in Libya ... #vote 3499
 I'd rather have Bush in the office than Romney 3500
 @itsgabrielleu @Tyrese @johnlegend @aliciakeys  Romney's Solution to women's right is to get women home earlier to cook dinner.. 3501
 I wonder what Mitt #Romney's policies will be next week #debate 3502
 How tf did Romney pass English in school? I know his paragraphs was naked as shit without the supporting details and only a topic sentence. 3503
 If Romney doesn't win, I'm moving to Mexico. 3504
 Romney should really make sure he knows what hes talking about ... Smh ! 3505
 @donnabrazile That statements speaks volumes of how inept Romney would be as president. 3506
 "@lahoare: 2. Romney came off worse in the debate -- in fact, he looked like a real jerk #debate" 3510
 Romney wins again!  3511
 Mittens Romney is full of not knowing the struggles of hard working people 3512
 Honestly. If you are a #woman and you vote for #Romney, you must be #INSANE. #backwardsSociety if it's #Romney in #November. 3515
 Romney made a definitely grave mistake on the Benghazi issue#msnbc2012 3516
 Romney don't care if we kill each other! #tf 3517
 @RomneyResponse I thought Gov. Romney was terrific. He was not obnoxious, he was respectful but exacting.  Pres did not tell the truth. 3518
 It's nice that Romney wants to make sure women in the work force can get home in time to make dinner. 3519
 @billmaher Romney buried himself by trampling the female moderator while saying he cares about women. The dissonance was striking. 3521
 Romney wants to kick off some shit with other countries. If he wins, get ready for another World War soon after 3523
 @Jay_Severin Romney does well in the 2 on 1 format. 3524
 Romney said he sat cross the table from people who lost their jobs. That's because he fired them 3526
 @FoxNews  Go Romney, next time go into more about Lybia!!! 3527
 This is not the last word on Benghazi. Romney must revisit this in the third debate. 3528
 I couldn't tell you what color hair Romney has if you asked. Or if he even has hair? 3529
 Romney looks like such a lying asshole 3530
 Beautiful night for Romney!!  Looks good for Romney focus group favires Romney 3532
 If Romney win i really think there will be riots 3533
 I wanted Mitt Romney to talk more of his plan, then talking about how Obamas plan hasn't worked 3537
 At this point, it is clear that there is no cogent explaination for why anyone should vote for Romney. 3538
 I will be applying to McGill university in Montreal as an escape from America if Romney is somehow able to win 3539
 Romney's Tax plan sounds very sketchy. Blueprint to income tax evasion?Great idea for the 47% and our mutual funds @barac @MSNBCRachel 3540
 Romney making sure the middle class never loses their yachts.... 3542
 This debate should clearly help the american people make up their mind, about who to vote for! Romney shown his truth self a bully and liar 3543
 #Romney did his best #VictorMeldrew impression tonight. #debate #UKView 3544
 Mitt Romney really all u can do is criticize what a real man is doing to help the U.S. get your head out your ass and get in the damn race 3545

 MT @KatyinIndy: RT this if you are sick of being lied to by Romney every time he opens his mouth! #debate 3554
 @TwitchyTeam Romney is. a Mormon not the devil 3555
 "What's the biggest difference between you [Mr. Romney] and George W. Bush?" Good question! 3556
 Romney did not answer the question about  Lilly Ledbetter that Prez signed on day 1 but he did have a binder full of women, how demeaning! 3557
 The best part of Romney's "close the loopholes" plan is the cap on charitable deductions. Because charity is killing the economy. #debate 3559
 @DntFckWitWorks: : Romney not helping anybody but the rich people. Making the rich richer and the poor poorer! 3560

 @ATLjackie I think the bubble of wealth is much thicker than White House bubble. Romney shows pique at process like a CEO.  #debate 3564
 @tamronhall I think Romney know about that attack on Libya much more than he is saying.....Did he have hands in this? Wow! 3565
 #Romney says his tax plan "adds up", but won't tell us the arithmetic. #faithbasedeconomics #debate2012 3566
 @thinkprogress Boohoo - Romney lost because he had to answer questions from the actual middle class! Poor Romney! Only the rich should ask! 3568
 Romney said he's going to cut the middle class tax back. Does that mean redefining the classes to broke, rich, and welthy? @AsSeenAtIUP 3570
 Obama and Romney come across as hating each other but you know they're playing golf together this weekend and having a cookout. 3571
 That nigga Romney can't even stay consistent. How can you trust him? 3572
 "@chrisrockoz: A Romney presidency would be great unless you're poor, gay, Mexican, Black, a woman, a student, or a dog. 3573
 Sometime people have to know when to shut up. Romney is not the devil, he's not evil or etc. STOP IT. 3574
 When can you tell Romney is lying?  When he talks. 3575
 @chrislhayes Romney described a affirmative action success to add women to his cabinet 3576
 Is Romney trying to start something with China? He flat out called them terrorists. Not a good thing to say ... 3578
 @MarineTimLee: Romney had 50% women on his executive staff. He genuinely care about how women are treated. so stupid haha 3579
 I would love to debate with Mitt Romney over a cup of coffee.... Wait.... 3580
 @abc7chicago I agree with Romney 3581
 @AnissaATaylor awesomely quick response. I'm glad you and I think alike! Snoop Dog had it right "Romney is every boss I ever hated." 3582
 #l2t while Romney was born rich and ivy league 3583

hey Romney, if "government doesn't create jobs" why the balls have you claimed you can do it the whole last hour and a half? 5498
#Romney asked to debunk misperceptions about him. AND, he references the 47% comment. #lohudvotes #debate 5499
----> RT @ClintColey: Oh really Mitt Romney? Your campaign isn't based on attacking Obama 5500
Hell Yea . ! ! ! ! Fuck Romney . http://t.co/0GK0oSCM 5501
Romney spends all his time going around the question before actually answering it . 5502
wait. Is Romney trying to say Obama's an atheist? I thought he was a muslim.... #herpderp 5503
@StrangeDasein Romney and @Nashlogic both have binders full of women. 5504
Romney-bot has passion? 5505
To me Obama and Romney are BOTH lying and that's a FACT! 5506
That was a pretty irrelevant question there bruh. Now Romney is talking about how he was a Pastor and believes in God. #DefenseMode 5507
Romney just said three time "Government cannot create jobs." umm so how does he plan on fixing things? 5508
@COURTNEYHALL_: Romney looks like he says nigger"all the time . Don't trust a guy with Grey sideburns just don't do it." 5509
All Obama has to say to rebut Romney is...the 47% video. What you say in secret is who you are. 5510
!!!! RT @rolandsmartin: Mitt Romney says government doesn't create jobs. So why does he keep saying he will create 12 million jobs if POTUS? 5511
Did Romney just pull the religion card? ! 5512
Assuming we are all "children of the same god" is ridiculously naive, Mr. Romney. #townhall2012 5513
Romney sit yo LYING ASS down!! 5514
If Romney Wins: POOF Now You See Me. POOF Now You Don't 5515
I Really Can't stand Mitt Romney 5516
Romney has really hairy knuckles. 5517
Romney is the anti Christ...I'm convinced then talkn bout he believe in God ain't nothing he doin Godly 5518
Pastor??? Did Romney say he was somebody's pastor? #presidentialdebate 5519
Romney believes in God 👏 5520
Really? Romney was a pastor? 5521
Mitt Romney, how can you say that you care about 100% of Americans when, on video, you disregarded 47% of them? 5522
Romney was a preacher ? Smh 5523
Is Romney positioning himself as the bailout guy? I don't think America wants a Bain-style bail-out. #debate 5524
Olympics were saved by federal funding, not Romney 5525
Do you? Do you really Romney?-Giahhn 5526
Romney cares about 100% - 47%. 5527
Romney, please don't pull the religion card. 5528
@tylera222 if I remember right, it was Romney at the beginning if the debate who thanked the moderator for hosting the event, Obama did not 5529
Romney talking bout he care about us kids now. The last debate, he didnt give a damn. 5530
@TheLastWord @MittRomney Than how, as President, the HEAD of the gov't, will Romney Create jobs, if Gov't Can't create jobs? 5531
Still cannot believe that a black man was actually elected as POTUS. That said, Mitt Romney can't believe it either. #debate2012 5532
@illytre25: Ok Romney idc what u did be4!!!!!!!!!!! 5533
What is going on with time on this debate?? 42 min Obama 38 Romney This is ridiculous! Better equal out at some point! 5534
Romney forget he didn't care about that 47% 5535
@dbrew101 Romney is boring! 5536
You were a pastor at your church, Mr. Romney? THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS A MORMON PASTOR MO FUCKER 5537
Mitt Romney trying to mainstream LDS religion by saying he was a pastor. LIAR! His church does not have pastors, only bishops 5538
Not a God question and Romney mentioned God and I kind of nailed it but it's so much worse. 5539
Romney that man didn't ask you about your damn religion. Answer the damn question. 5540
Why would Romney say 100% when Obama hasn't mentioned the 47%? I think I just saw a light bulb go on above Obama's head 5541
I Believe we are all Children of the Same God #Mitt Romney 5542
Romney's right, we don't have to settle. 5543

He just did ha RT "@nytjim: Obama doesn't mention 47 percent, but Romney says he cares about "100 percent of the American people"" 5573
Romney: Also in articles when you've stated "I'm not concerned with the really poor." 5574

Obama Get To The Point EveryTime Romney Be Trying To Add Stuff That Have Nothing To Do With America 5590
Why won't Romney mention the word , "Massachusetts?" 5591
Mitt Romney hasn't been in Government but was Gov. of Mass?  How does that work? 5592
Prediction:  FOX says Romney won this debate.  Every other channel says Obama won the debate. 5593
Obama said he believe Romney is a good man and loves his family. Then he wanted to say, BUT HE DON'T GIVE A FUCK ABOUT AMERICA!!!!!LOL 5594

Obama pulled a "rope a dope" on Romney with the Libya comment! (confirmed?) #debates #HofstraDebate 5813
