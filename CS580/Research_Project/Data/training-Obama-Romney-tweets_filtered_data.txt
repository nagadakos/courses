Obama dominated that debate... 
The fact that this debate will be recapped by Libya is not great for Obama. 
Obama definitely secured the illegal immigrant vote. 
Obama drones on and says nothing 
Obama gave more guns to Mexican drug cartels than he did the consulate staff in Benghazi, so there's that. 
Tonight Barack showed, as he has every day as president, that he’ll fight to ensure everyone has a fair shot at the American Dream. –mo 
You can combine the speaking skills of Churchill, Reagan, and Lincoln, and President Obama could still not defend his own record.

Me voting for Obama would be like me running my head into a wall, over and over and over and over! 
I find it revealing few people even comment on, much less get troubled by, Obama talking about "hunting people down" like he's a T-1000 
I really would like to tweet my opinion on the debate tonight but I don't think I could fit it into 140 characters how ridiculous Obama is. 
If Obama is here... who's running hell? #SHFL

Obama is what we need for a steady, permanent improvement in our country. Y'all already know who I'll be voting for. #fuckmitt #Obama2012 
Let's be clear: Obamais no great friend to immigrants and brown people around the world. #debate 
Our economy has raised 17% in the last four years,Obama made something out of nothing 
I truthfully can't stand listening to Obama.. He hasn't done anything to get us out of debt so why the heck  would you vote for him 
Obama got more immigrants out of here than any other president.

Obama takes way to much credit for killing Osama Bin Laden. I'm pretty sure that was the navy seals. 
Not even close. A complete reversal from the first debate, Obama winning on every level. Audience connection, emotional appeals, facts.

Obama claims "low skill" jobs belong overseasâ€¦shows his real lack of concern as it regards having ALL Americans being able to WORK 
Obama should say I want world peace and drop the mic! 
@jaronjones That exchange was a complete embarrassment for Obama.  He had nothing to say in his defense. 
Obama literally just said some jobs aren't coming back and that he doesn't want low-skill jobs. High-skilled industry can't employ everyone.

@TheLastWord @BarackObama  I wish President Obama would have brought up the fact that the Republicans want to get rid of minimum wage. 
You just had to know that Obama would close with a 47% jab. 
Obama talks so slow...

Obama is a nice person. 
I'm all for Obama. That's all i'm saying about this political crap.

This was a great debate! Good job Obama! 
Now that's the assertiveness I want to see from President Obama. 
President #Obama was better, he was more specific, confident. MSNBC it might be easily considered Obama's best debate performance.

Obama believes in fairness, not ingenuity and hardwork.

AMEN!!!!!!!  RT @HarryLarris: Bottom line. Obama lied about the Rose Garden comments.  So did Candy Crowley. Shameful. #tcot 
Obama Has A Clean Line Up Tho. 
Eghh. As an objective viewer, gotta give the edge to Obama. No way this was a draw. 
Obama got too much confidence Mitten 
Obama should look in the camera and say : look me in my face "I ain't got no worries! " ! 
Words for words...points by points...President Obama explained, corrected or just shuttled the door on.... BRAVO, MR. PRESIDENT!... 
I'm tired of everybody talking bout the first debate Obama did what was suppose to be done he studied his opponent  #BeatIt 
Why would you ask Obamas campaign manager about her opinion? Shes obviously gonna defend Obama 
â€œ@AnnCoulter: will love to see O in the unemployment line. Obama clinging to his job and paycheck.â€ 
I don't see the need to bash either of the candidates If you don't like Obama don't vote for him easy as that No need for all the negativity 
my vote is for Barack Obama 
Obama was more agressive this time tho.... I give him that. 
@CarolineManzo me either but people are calling for Obama as the winner... 
@KalebDaniel305 Obama can keep talking and you can KEEP listening but all I hear is rhetoric. 
@centsiblelife Obama, hands down 
@airPLane20 Obama was, but he isnt the cause of the recession. and the recession caused the giant spike in unemployment 
@ErinBurnett I live in oil Obama has cost many jobs. Who is he kidding? He crushed south La 
If the debate tonight had been Game 7 of the Finals #BallGame #Obama #ConfettiAndChampagneShower 
#Debates-helloooo, compare apples to apple's... Obama is comparing capital gains income to  payroll income, not the same tax criteria! 
RT â€œ@AntDeRosa: InTrade has Obama winning the debate at 91%â€ 
Obama just had that professional classy swag tonight. #Yum 
@ParkergirlUSA |  Obama dug deeper with the lie about the Rose Garden statement being a terrorist attack. 
@ThisWeekABC  yes this is Obama victory 
Obama got in the 47% AS THE LAST WORD.  Yay! 
The left admits defeat, the right can never do that, Obama won tonight, and Biden won last week 
Obama referenced the glass ceiling. Mah man. 
I think it's safe to say Obama #slayed 
Obama dominated the debate. Nice to see he is back :) #Obama #CNNDebate 
Obama won 
I think Obama came on strong tonight 
wish audience had asked Obama why he did not do all the things he continues to pledge to do if given 4 yrs 
C'mon, @arifleischer. We both know #Obama didn't talk ab his plans because HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY. #debate #cnn 
@mehdirhasan he probably believes that Obama doesn't believe in the same god as he does or that Obama is a Muslim. 
@xoxo_MonaeLove Again he helped FIX that economy after Obama let the entire Nations economy crash and led to all state economies crashing 
#Obama went over time. The host said time was up. His reply "this is important" IT'S also important 2 follow the rules #presidentialdebate 
The truth squad #Obama 
Obama >>>>> 
Every time I see someone say "name one thing Obama did" my response will be "lol bin laden" 
Sounds like Obama won the debate #IDidntWatchIt #BetterThingsToDo 
Obama won the debate decisively. http://t.co/c9mCQT56 
Obama sure tries to make himself look better by lying.. He needs to try a lot harder.! #2012PresidentialDebate 
 Voted today 4 #Obama #iowavoting #Obama2012 #needsomeonewitharealplan 
David Plouffe is exactly why Obama can't get 4 more years. #tool 
Obama got dis!!! #TEAMObama 
So true! But then there are some people who like Obama for welfare, but they're not poor, just too lazy to get a job you know? @Jayadiva39 
@KatieeB_ people who think Obama's health care ideas are a good thing need a nice slap across the back of the head........... With a shovel. 
On that last response by Obama....that boy went Jordan...Game 6 *Jay-Z Voice* 
Thats a #Win for #Obama 
#Obama 
@andyeisenbacher We cannot keep going I. The direction we have been going... Obama and those before him! 
â€œ@TheDemocrats: We're proud to be #TeamBarackâ€”RT if you are too.â€ #Obama 
So Obama in the last debate got it handed to him:-)  he actually tried this time and I'd still give the edge to Romney #gomitt 
Watched the debate, obviously. I find Obama's energy policy laughable when earlier he said he planned to increase energy prices. 
RT: ABC and Fox Fact Check Obama:  Oil & Gas Drilling Permits ARE Down 60% Under Obama. #debates #utpol 
â€œShe works for me. Iâ€™m the president. And Iâ€™m always responsible.â€ - President Obama, taking responsibility fâ€¦ http://t.co/pMiSfhF9 
Obama, look bud, you cant make up lies about what someone just say two mins ago.. Recorded dumbass! 
The moment Obama won! http://t.co/Z3U9cGob 
Why do people think things are gonna get better if Obama is re-elected? It will be the exact same as the last 4 years. I don't understand. 
Obama or civil war 
Read the transcript. RNC chair accuses Obama of lying about Libya and moderator "aided and abetted." 
So why does Obama get props for bin laden, but doesn't get held responsible for unemployment, he inherited both, be fair I'm that 
That was fun!! I wish I had some snacks tho. Vodka flowing and fearing for the morning. Obama is back, Spain is in the clear, Greece is TOST 
As I predicted Democrats would say Obama won overwhelmingly. I am shocked Democrats would say their candidate won. 
#Obama wants to reinstate "assault weapons" ban. I'm glad that's on the record. #guncontrol 
@JustCeeC: President Obama should have dropped the mic and wall off stage after that last answer! I'd drop the mic for him. Lol 
#PDSLive republicans control the Oil. They raise the prices to make it look like Obama is doing badly. Even though we have surpluses 
@RyanSeacrest President Obama. 
Obama did good tonight 
Romney just got roasted. Deny it all you want ,republicans, but a monkey could judge that Obama won #debate2012 
@neaboo89 the problems Obama didn't create 
Obama has appeared weak and tired in several recent public forums. I wonder if he actually even wants to be president anymore... 
Obama talked louder, but didn't tell us what he would differently than he is already doing. Talked a lot,but said nothing. An empty suit. 
It's funny how these retired senators that are republicans are endorsing Obama 
I only wish Obama would have shown this vigor during the last debate! #Debate2012 
Obama keeps my hope alive in good men. 
Binder-women & "My pension is not as large as yours" will be the 2 memorable quotes from tonight's #debate. It's a draw edging toward Obama. 
@T_Bevs HAHA! Vote Obama! For Murphy Brown!! 
Obama's got this one in the bag #likecomeon #hehasamovie 
Obama 2012, President Obama WON the debate, vote early where your state allows and on November 6, 2012 
We  we confess that humility clothes President Obama and goodness and mercy are following him. Psalm 23 
Political beliefs aside, Obama belatedly lied about Libya. There is no denying it. The man has ZERO character. 
#foxnews krauthhammer says Obama won! 
Emergency Blood Transfusion and fully covered health appointments and you want to convince me that I shouldn't vote for Obama!! #Obama2012 
@ChristopherHahn Obama had a couple strong moments.  National security (except "terror act" claim) and 47%/free enterp.  Showed leadership 
@ptutman President Obama won debate tonight. 
Even fox is calling Obama the winner lol 2012 Obama 
.@edshow Shultz points to ND as example of Obama energy policy?  That's PRIVATE land they're drilling on!  Permits down 50% = TRUTH #debate 
Obama most definitely won this debate. 
President Obama on equal pay: "This is not just a women's issue, this is a family issueâ€”this is a middle-class issue. 
@christinaa_D well you have your opinions and i have mine. I think he will do better than what Obama has done in the past 4 years. 
@WorldsDumbest: President Obama!!!! 
@TheStalwart @cbsnews CBS poll said Obama won the first debate! 
Obama < 
@HighClass_Taste: I remember in 2008 wen Obama won...we was about to get jumped at U.D!And at WSU 
Of course I'm voting for President Obama I don't see any other alternative ;) haha 
President Obama was concise and to the point. Round 2 goes to him. 
Obama's a champ 
Why would you vote Obama? He lied about the deaths of 4 Americans overseas over national tv!da fuck 
@iRoqueKurls my coworker are going in on president Obama... I wish I could show you what some if them are thinking... 
MSM is basically saying that Obama won this one because he wasn't as lousy as he was last time. 
Remember when Obama said 4 years ago that he was gonna cut national debt in half? That's funny because its almost doubled #idiot 
80% say Obama won #kewl 
@ZachMarin34 Obama definitely learned from the first debate! 
I could get to watch about half of the debate...What I felt Mr. President, Obama's sincerity...I support Obama.  He is a good man! 
Man I hope Obama win though.. 
People need to understand the US Government's process before they bash Obama. Things that haven't been achieved are not from lack of effort 
Obama was terrific, now for the win... 
@moonyzhang aren't you sided with Obama too ? 
@edshow President Obama won. Willard kept going back to talking points & lies. Bet the righties didn't mind his interrupting. 
Obama gets alot of votes for being mixed. Don't lie. 
Obama came on strong tonite.  Showed he is commander in chief. 
#LNYHBT  Tired of listening to Obama be a stranger to the truth. His failure to answer the questions asked and standard rhetoric. 
Obama won this debate. Case closed. 
#Obama-Biden2012 
@LarisaNBlack1 @DelenaHowell Yes I hope everyone votes....Obama. Can you tell I'm pro Obama lol! 
Obama >>>> 
Krauthammer: Obama wins debate on points

Its seriously impossible to double the national debt in four years. And it wasn't only 8 trillion in 2008. #NiceTryThough #Obama! 
@jedlewison: CBS poll of uncommitted voters: Obama wins debate. 
@crowleyNN Look at this, from September 27: "Obama Administration Finally Admits That the Libya Attack Was Terrorism": http://t.co/S9894sXz 
Obama won debate easily 
2008 Obama "I believe this nation is in need for change."2012 Obama "I believe this nation is in need for change." 
@MichaelSkolnik @CBSNews Obama won! 
@danabrams If nothing else, it may energize Obama's base, which could be enough (they hope). #debates 
@BarackObama President Obama showed his strength tonight. A lot of factually facts were stated from the President. Great job!!!! 
i really wish i could vote for Obama :'( 
What can't be argued is that what Obama has done over the past four years hasn't worked. Plain and simple 
@Hrothgar_KP the situation for young white college grads under Obama is only going to get worse...much worse...ive studied economics 
@chrisrockoz second round knock out Pres Obama. 
If Obama thought Libya was an act of terror, why did he & his staff come out on numerous tv shows for 2 WEEKS citing a video was to blame?!! 
@tiffanyshlain #Debates "Float like a butterfly,sting like a bee" #Obama 's 47 point knockout in the last round was just like #MuhammadAli . 
 Liberals are thinking that Obama won as clearly this time he was awake #debates #laughable 
Didn't even watch the debate because I can't stand listening to Obama make excuses for the hundreds of thousands of lazy Americans we have. 
@1rutwilldo yeah. Obama's response to initial question was weak. The follow up question got a little weird. 
Obama hit a grand slam tonight, look for a 3-4 point bounce! Congrats Mr President 
Obama got a good point 
My Pop was 2 stepping, yelling "Obama' earlier around the house! Now he's really excited to vote, like it's his first time! Lol 
@TheLastWord @mittRomney Exactly. Obama is an angry, spoiled child. 
@mr_webber32 Obama did better buying don't think he won. 
Obama delivers the final knock out. #debates 
Obama ended with 47%?... whaaaat don't make me laugh 
Obama was so annoyed 
check out the 2012 labor participation rate...lowest in over 10 year by US Dept of Labors own numbers...Bad Obama policies are to blame! 
Moderator was way out of line helping Obama with the Libya lie!  OMG 
@LCoop34: Obama is a great speaker 
@seanhannity Totally agree. Obama had nothing to bring to the debate. 
@kadeemedwards Well I don't even have something funny for this. I guess whatever Obama wants to do he can do, because he has heat vision. 
I'm Tired Of Hearing Ppl Say The UnEmployment Rate Has Increased Since Obama Became President... 
@mblessing2 yeah she made him doubt his facts on which he was correct on, its because Candy has almost parralel views to Obama on the topic 
I dont understand #Obama lies when there is fact check. We are going to find out the truth so why lie? 
Wow RT @Mike_notmichael: But... RT @LsKSwagSwag Obama deserves another 4 years. If he can't get the job done after that then he gotta go 
â€œ@JCarrizales_5: â€œ@NatalyyDee: I don't want Obama to win.â€ #Carrizales4Presidentâ€ .. Obama please win! 
The fact Obama is probably the first president to have teenagers watch the debate >> 
What has Obama done in the last four years to improve America! Nothing! He lost the debate!!! 
I think the point of this debate is, you can't beat Obama, unless you're Obama^2. #fb 
Checked into Fox News to see how they're handling their candidate's defeat...Hannity vows to "fact check Obama's lies" 
Wow - this group didn't think Obama performed well at all. 'Just attacked' & had no ideas, didn't answer questions & was totally on defense. 
@jennifercarolyn @CoryBooker With the way inflation is going if we have another 4 years of Obama you will not be able to afford ice cream.

 @gretawire I think Obama showed himself to try to bully voters. 
 If Obama gets re-elected, imagine how much he will blame the previous "administration". 
 FUCK FOX NEWSSS....m'fuckas on Obama's shit......smh 
 Taxing all millionaires at 90% would fund the government for 3 months. Great plan Obama. #debates 
 Barack Obama plays basketball therefore he has my vote. 
 All lies and phony stock market bubbles with Obama and his corrupt bankers. We have massive fraud with no justice. @cspanwj #tcot #cspj #p2 
 @RyanSeacrest Obama hands down!! 
 Obama named winner by CBS, CNN, Google and PPP snap polls. I always view these polls. But they give hints like in first debate 
 Yay. Obama said the same nothing, defending his terrible record with more energy this time! #debate2012 
 @MikNastyy yeah and what a bad election that was!!Your right the debate is over good job and u still didn't learn anything!?Obama is wrong 
 World busy talking about Romney and Obama. 
 @Gregory_Danger you do realize that Obama straight up lied about Libya 
 Obama signed 3 trade deals, but rejected 18...hmmmm. 37M 2008 food stamps, 47M now, 23M unemployed now. 7.8 unemployed 2008, 7.8 now hmmm! 
 @kristalsanford Obama didnt get elected without a majority of white people voting for him.It would be impossible to win through the minority 
 Obama saved the auto industry which has since added 100,000 jobs. 
 @David_Gergen I thought it was clear Obama win, but I always respect your analysis. Keen and well balanced. 
 Anyone else find it interesting Obama wore a red tie and Romney wore a blue tie tonight? They represent the other parties color. #Debates 
 "@5hannnnnon: Obama shut up you nigger. You're a liar. Your brother lives in Kenya where you were born. #Romney2012" Damn nt cool 
 Obama speaks with forked tongue #debate 
 Do people not realize that Romney is not a Christian? He believes in God, yes. But so does Obama. 
 @CaptKrunch Obama's campaign is toast. Lying for a liar, nice. 
 All jokes aside- Obama was solid. Handled himself well 
 According to #cnn, #Obama wins this debate by 7 points 
 Obama bought his A game tonight! Women you need to protect your right to choose. Stand up and VOTE. 
 @IngrahamAngle Americans died, and Obama lied. 
 #Obama always seems so exasperated talking about #energy. "Seriously, we have to think of the FUTUR... oh, forget it. You're not listening." 
 @Bawlz_95 #Wrong Obama is a dumbass.. 
 @___ADG so many people are in debt because his Obama care is forcing people to have health insurance . Even though they can't afford it 
 @NonaWA Seriously! Obama on contraception and Planned Parenthood was the best he was all night. Politically smart and morally right! 
 @HLNTV Obama won!!!! 
 I ALREADY voted for Obama ! #EarlyVote 
 Obama utterly lied for 2 weeks about Benghazi and then tonight YOUR PRESIDENT lied directly to every single american's face...LIVE 
 @CherylStrayed: Obama for the win! #OFA 
 @gretawire Oh, P Buchanan where was Obama right? or doing well? the man was bitter sour ignorant arrogant & a very small performance 
 Basically Obama is the man 
 Obama did a much better job this time than in last debate. He was engaged this time. It wasn't enough #debates 
 Obama did very well, but the msnbc folks are I think vastly overestimating the impact on the race. 
 @russllj Obama was really good this evening. I was smiling! 
 @megynkelly I was uncomfortable with Obama's stand -up & interrupt routine. It was a well-practiced rudeness that failed as strength. 
 Obama constantly lies to the American people. He avoids answering questions. The choice is clear, #RomneyRyan2012 @gretawire 
 @GinoGraul @2homeboys Obama creates no jobs.He's had almost 4yrs to do something & he hasn't.And the 1st 2 yrs he had a democrat congress! 
 The debate was real, Obama was pretty feisty. 
 I didn't like Obama, but then I watched the presidential debate... and I still don't like Obama. 
 Oh yes he can!!  Barack Obama that's my president!! 
 Obama is aggressive and poised he's not taking Romney's shit this time. 
 @CNN For the mess that Bush left us, we couldn't have got a more hardworking POTUS than Obama. We are proud of him! 
 Obama was the bad boyfriend who stayed out all night,made promises he never kept. Don't run back to him-it's time to MOVE ON. #tcot #debate 
 If Obama wins the election I'm officially moving to Canada for the next four years. #GodHelpUs #RomneyandRyan 
 @Thomlane @LessaT In the 1st debate, it seemed Obama was aloof and disconnected. In this one, angry. Probably more un-Presidential n this 1. 
 @TheWorldOfAphil we've all seen from the talks of Obama's birth certificate that even birthdays can be controversial. 
 Wish I was at the debate. I woulda asked Obama how he allowed China, Coke, and Pepsi to drive up the price of protein by 35%. Dead serious 
 Mitt Romney did an awesome job in the debate tonight. Took President Obama to task, we can't afford another four years of this mess. 
 @thebighoot @comfypaws "combat forces" not trainers/other designated forces, exactly where Biden?Obama failed to keep our victories,win Iran 
 If we gave George bush a second term and he fucked us why can't we give president Obama another chance #Obama4president 
 Obama is gonna be speaking within 100 yards of where i sleep but i know my head wont get off this pillow to see it 
 I would just like to say, it doesn't matter where u r from the question is how he is going to make the country better. #Obama 
 @_Anthonypadilla and Obama lost the debate 
 The debate was interesting but I am Team Obama all the was 
 Finished watching the entire debate. Obama won hands down. 
 @WheresMyLiberty that doesn't even make sense. I'm not supporting Obama. I'm supporting someone who actually has a shot at beating him. 
 I don't even have commentary for this debate because President Obama executed and dominated 
 I'm gonna laugh when Obama wins and the country will be in the worst state ever and I'm gonna just laugh in your retarded faces. 
 Election 2012: The Decision For Investors: Obama Vs. Romney on taxes, dividends and investment gains. 
 A second term #Obama will #ban #guns a first term #Romney will not #banguns it's that simple. 
 The BBC homepage photo of the Presidential Debate makes Romney and Obama look like a two man boyband. 
 Dear Mr. Obama: "You sit on a throne of lies!" - Buddy the Elf 
 The debate was on point #Obama 
 @samval623 and not through social media. All I see is people bashing either Romney or Obama. If its a valid point to make then fine 
 Vote for Obama so I can continue having great sex without the fear of a baby 
 The nightmare known as the Obama administration is almost over. 20 days left to his defeat. :-)  #debate2012 
 Obama finally kicked some ass in this debate! #YeaaaaahBudddy 
 I wonder what would happen if we put Romney and Obama were one person. Boom! My friends would get along. This is why I stay out of politics. 
 President Obama does not even know the laws of the land...what a fucking idiot....read the Arizona Law, Mr. Lawyer before you talk about it 
 Why the heck was Romney even involved in #debate ?We need not forget that Obama has been there for 4 years and he has removed one Bin Laden 
 Wow - so Obama WAS wrong over Benghazi ... 
 Just remembered Obama is on @TheDailyShow tomorrow night! Confetti and balloons! Woot!! 
 Obama totally won the debate today. No doubt. 
 @peggychinn  I like that too, go Obama :) 
 @politicsmonkey I maintain that Obama will win. It will be close, but comfortable enough due to the electoral college… 
 You know I'm almost glad I missed the debate tonight.  Can't stand the garbage that comes from Obama's mouth.  Makes me sick. 
 Horrified at how badly Obama seems to be doing in the debates 
 Obama lost debate. 
 Barack Obama the 44th president of the United States 2008-2016. 
 I can't wait till Obama wins. I will seriously stand up in my history class and scream, "HAHA FUCK YOU GREG LOGAN." 
 Crowley: America Took 10 Days Jan 20 2008 to Jan 30 2008 to Claim Obama was one big ass mistake  An Attack on America citizens 
 #Obama #Romney  Lies spoken in an articulate manner are still lies. This is a Obama's way.  He stood on the debate stage and lied..Fire him 
 @Talkmaster If Romney had to describe how different he is from W, shouldn't Obama '12 have to show how he's different from the last 4 yrs? 
 Obama is a criminal fraud, a usurper. If you notice, you are a "birther." It doesn't matter which crime you notice. #gop #tcot #p2 #dems 
 Obama had the better tie last night. #debate 
 Vote for Obama when you guys get the chance when the time comes around its a great choice 
 New campaign add by Obama features Morgan Freeman on a voice over. Shit, now how can you NOT vote for Obama? I mean its Morgan Freeman! 
 Shake my Sheets! @andersoncooper Actually Admitted that " #Obama didn't answer certain questions in #Debate" 
 Vote Obama!!! The republicans won't help pay for school!!!! Vote Obama because he's the only one who gives a fuck!!!! 
 There's going to be #bindersfullofwomen voting for Obama 
 @AdhikariKshitiz nope didn't watch it but tomorrow I will get the chance 2 :) I heard that #Obama was #brilliant! #debate #TeamObama 
 Obama won with "Walmart Moms," sayeth a headline, narrowly edging "Coors Light Dads" to win the Depressing Subdeomographic Title Contest. 
 Both Romney and Obama have really annoying speaking voices  
 The worlds gonna be one fucked up place if Obama takes presidency again #realtalk 
 Based on what I heard Obama say last night, if he gets re-elected, I am tempted to give up-close my business and unemploy 230+ folks! 
 @realDonaldTrump Obama was more of a boistrous bull spouting out the same old things that he DIDN'T achieve in 4 years and can't in 4 more. 
 @PaulRyanVP Ask America why the press has never ask Obama the tough questions these last 4 years. 
 @MeKaymi_Tensei He carried himself poorly in that debate, but I do think the shitty moderator gave Obama an advantage he didn't need. 
 @uhlyssaoliviero - if Obama gets elected, guys like me will go out of business. People who pay the taxes that enable fin aid, will be gone 
 I bet Obama was the kid in class who could smooth talk his teachers into postpone homework...but never actually turned it in 
 Obama has connections with Al queda terrorist organization. 
 @sallykohn why don't you say that to the families face. You are a loser. By the way, Obama lost the debate. 
 @AdrianneCurry Would just rather not vote for a Socialist (Obama) 
 @fantaztika @TheRealRoseanne @rebabrooks @ConsiderThis1 I love Roseanne, but taking Obama's votes is uncool as hell, this is not a joke. 
 #music PROUD OF YOU MR. PRESIDENT BARAK OBAMA Watching second presidential debate is on #TeamObama 
 @wrocorn CNN proves again they are in the tank for a man who consistently lies to America.  CNN is not news, it's propaganda! Obama LIES! 
 Here bit by bit the American people are standing up to Socialisim,Communisim,Marxist Muslims and Obama the Black Master of Black the people. 
 Oh yeah. I love getting yelled about Obama at 9 in the morning #grandmaprobs 
 If you read today's news headlines, you'd think Obama and Romney were in a UFC cage match instead of using mildly heated rhetoric. 
 @TheTimmyTebow  Try to find something good to say about somebody if u can but lv Obama alone. It's not flattering to u. 
 I don't appreciate how Obama capitalisizes on the fact that he's black. 
 @BillPhill12 Omg, that was the funniest thing ever - and every person struggling in Obama's economy wanted to say it, too. 
 AllI can say about last night's debate is that Obama looked pretty desperate. 
 Obama called Romney an Azzhole!  #Funny 
 The amount of Obama impressions I hear is sickening. 
 But honestly, My opinion is neutral this year, and that's why I'm not even voting. Both Mitt and Obama are f'n shit up. Why bother... #meh 
 Shit that was a low blow to Obama omg lol 
 @bogealoge I don't have to I know what Obama promised hasn't come true 
 Obama is so cute 
 Obama administration can't get even the simple aid to Syrian rebels right.  It is going to the Assad govt. 
 #Obama 2012-2016 
 I don't "hate" anyone... But I SERIOUSLY dislike Obama. The man irritates the hell out of me. Romney isn't much better. Reset button plz?! �� 
 @TheValorieClark i don't like either one. I am more socially conservative. But Obama hasn't done enough good in his first four years. 
 I'm going to put an #Obama & #Romney sticker on my car to confuse people. The good news is that I don't particularly like either of them... 
 @MichelleObama  awesome we really need Mr. Obama to win! 
 It's amazing looking at my twitter and Facebook feeds and seeing how republican my friends are. I was a miracle Obama even got in office. 
 Someone had a sticker on they car that said defeat Obama. Everybody should get out they car to whoop they ass 
 @DatBiebsGrande your not even worth fighting for so goodbye have a  sucking Obama shit day(: 
 Obama gone win again 
 President Obama doesn't even answer a ligit question about the Libya situation ...or didn't want 2. Families of the deceased want answers. 
 I really don't like bringing politics on social networks but despite my confusion I think I might go with Obama ... 
 .@SpoonerSpot Exactly. Obama & Romney are too well-rehearsed with stats that make voters' eyes glaze over. #debate 
 @seanhannity Did you notice Obama's demeanor and voice when Romney smacked him about Libya, he was pissed. 
Obama nailed it! #ObamaAtOU #fourmoreyears 
 Obama made the case for his 2nd term.  He showed the country his values and beliefs. 
 @UnPoliticalPrty I had to block that guy, if I wanted to hear to lies I'd listen to Obama. 
 Majority of undecided Xbox Live voters declare Obama victor of town hall debate:  Of the 2,000 or so undecided v...  
 Obama stated that we shall no more see warfare weapons on our streets. So please at least wrap them in a paper bag. #spinoza 
 #Obama probably gives out those little boxes of raisins on Halloween. 
 I tried to find a binder of women for $20 or less on Ebay. After coming up short, I decided to donate the $20 to Obama's campaign instead... 
 Who better to deceive the people than they own kind ... I really think Obama a puppet 
 We caught #Romney leaving church, caught #Obama a bar and drinking beer.. God gets you further then beer does! #TeamRomney 
 @dcwomenkicknass I never claimed to be a Romney supporter. I just don't support Obama. 
 @IngrahamAngle u were great on @OreillyFactor,,Obama wasn't good, he just set the bar really low the last time #Debates 
 Obama is averaging 5.7 lies per minute of talking during this #debate 
 Obama had the best debate ! 
 Obama still hasn't told us when he's writingng his fair share tax check. Go ahead, put ur $ where ur mouth is. 
 I love how Obama always has a big ass smile on his face 
 He jus said the magic number Obama won dis debate #47% 
Obama won. Libya and that closing. The pension quip. 
 Man oh man I hope Obama wins. We're so screwed if not. 
 Obama did a great job 
 Obama won the debate 
 @ewilliam_ Obama record on what he promised and failed to do hurts him 
 One thing is clear…Obama legitimately does not like Romney as a person. He finds Mitt's success contemptible. #debates 
 @KimPinkx3 Obama is a huge supporter of community college 
 Idgaf if Obama is black, that's NOT a reason why we are voting for him! He's just amazing all around 
 Clearly Obama won! #debate2012 #obama #democrats #leggo 
 president Obama is the first president to get teenagers and young adults involved in watching the debate and want to vote 
 Obama has a lot of support. 
 @Lil3jmg My parents think Obama is the worst thing to ever happy to the United States. So glad I don't share the views as they do. 
 Proud to be a registered voter right about now, damn right I am voting for Obama again.......who mad? 
 @greggutfeld Obama had four more minutes of LIES!!! #debate 
 BREAKING: Shortly after the debate, Obama and Moderator Candy Crowley seen giving each other a high-five... #tcot #p2 #debate 
 I honestly don't want Obama or Romney to win. 
 Don't expect me to defend Obama's policies & broken promises. Like I said, blind political allegiance is funny. "@a_tweet_life @Al_Gorelioni 
 I think Obama is secretly a terrorist. His name scares me. "Barack Obama" come on son'! 
 Y'all see this shit --->"@5hannnnnon: Obama shut up you nigger. You're a liar. Your brother lives in Kenya where you were born. #Romney2012" 
 @Dakota_bruhh in all honesty, what has changed in your life to make you mad at Obama? 
 I say we have a hunger games politics style Obama vs Romney an throw Ron Paul and Herman Caine in there for kicks 
 Everyone Is Entitled To Their Own Opinions.. But I'm Proud To Say That I'm Voting For Obama. #thatisall 
 I've seen 3 Presidents look at and lie to the American people. Nixon, Clinton, now Obama. Obama's lie involved the death of four people. 
 This quote is for everyone who voted for Obama in 2008. "Fool me once shame on you. Fool me twice shame on me." #Romney2012 
 President Obama lied to the American population tonight. Dug a whole new hole for him on this Lybia thing. #Debates 
 Ed Gillespie: "For every job Obama admin created, 6 people left the workforce".  #debates 
 "99% of Obama's policies didn't work. Just like the people that voted for him." 
 Obama-Thanks for answering questions in the first minute of your turn instead of walking around them..... #abcpolitics 
 Obama shut up your a liar. Romney shut up your a liar. 
 Polls say Obama 46% vs Romney 39%. #debates 
 Even in 2008, Obama didnt statistically show he was a good enough candidate for Dew. 
 @aegies @BarackObama If i had the money and wasn't so broke because of college, i'd top that with $200. Obama's got my full support and vote 
 @itsKirenbitch Obama is classy as fuck. I wish I was American so I could vote for him. 
 I love how Obama brought in the hiring of teachers into the AK47 question. WTF? For the record hiring more gov doesn't grow the economy. 
 THIS WILL GET YO ASS BEAT"@5hannnnnon: Obama shut up you nigger. You're a liar.Your brother lives in Kenya where you were born. #Romney2012" 
 @DavidLimbaugh Obama not as compelling a liar as Clinton was. Not to mention media monopoly is not the same. 
 @akinfolaju how do u do... Didn't watch it but using wat I have read so far it was a good nite for Obama 
 "I know people that have healthcare because of Obama." ... "I know people that have jobs because of Obama." (via @jferg & @benjaminkelley) 
 Obama totally ignored nor really nswered questions on Benghazi or "Fast & Furious"!  And MSM says he "won"? LOL 
 Obama wins the 2nd debate! (Once the conservative commentators go for the moderator you know their candidate lost) 
 #Obama is the truth. 
 @AlexisClewis24 and like I said I dot care who president is.. But Obama sure as hell didnt do a good job fixing ANYTHING 
 @AshleyOkinawa lld I didn't say anything to harm their party, Romney did that for himself.I just commented on Obama! 
 @gaylortangg and Obama has strikingly similar ideologies to Jimmy Carter and Karl Marx, both of whom know nothing of successful nations. 
 Obama did not answer the question on Libya. Romney missed the opportunity to demand an answer n the moderator didnt demand an answer either! 
 "@coledixon15: Obama is a self centered jackass that needs to take his foreign ass back to his Muslim countries." @llcoollittle & this guy 2 
 @RNCResearch Heck it wasn't the lies that are the problem, it was the lack of ideas from Obama, so another four years of the same. 
 The Republican goal is not to beat Obama down. It's to shake down and beat down the American people. Keep your heads up. Obama 2012. 
 If I have to listen to one more Obama speech, I think I will end up in a loony bin. What a grating voice. 
 If Obama wasn't running for president would you still be excited about politics? 
 From assault rifles to education, Obama you are OWNING this debate. Brilliant public speaker, just fucking brilliant. 
 I am so pumped up right now. I cannot even sleep. #TeamObama - tonight we saw why we are going to do everything we can to reelect #Obama 
 Bringing manufacturing back question: Romney - China is a cheat and a thief. #yellowperilObama - invest in advance manufacturing, R&D, tech 
 Will @BarackObama EVER correct Romney? The vast majority of that deficit is Bush's--particularly his 2 wars Obama finally put on the books! 
 Listen Obama, Wallstreet and the big car companies you bailed out are in the same league. Quit blaming other people for your problems. 
 Finally just watched the debate on DVR.  Heated and what I have been waiting for, Obama was on the defensive for most of it. 
 I will admit, #Bush's spending was out of control. But Obama's spending habits... just completely unacceptable #NotFittoGovern #Debate2012 
 Obama you got Morgan Freeman to be spokesman on one of your commercials? Well since you got God to speak highly of you, you will win. 
 Obama did lower taxes on middle class. No Job, No Money, Lower Taxes #lnyhbt 
 @lindaph1 Hell Obama can't even take care of one border patrol agent how can he handle diplomatic security? BHO Admin. is a chinese cluster. 
 Barack Obama wins the debate. Bristol Palin voted off Dancing With The Stars. It's a great night to be a liberal in America! 
 Election news, CNN calls it for Obama. FOX News calls it for Romney. Adult Swim calls it a clear victory for Meatwad. 
 Today's Presidential Debate ws OK. For me, #Obama is a winner today by an Inch, jst 1 inch. He shud b more Charged up in d nxt &last rd. 
 Obama whooped both Romney and the moderator! Dayummmm #Obama2012 
 Taliban shot #Malala for her ideal was #Obama, All female fans of Brad Pitt, Justin Bieber etc should be careful in Pakistan 
 Wondering how polls can say Obama won the debate but Romney won on issues.  It's hard to understand polling at times! #perception #debate 
 Obama's voice is so assuring. 
 Heard Obama used Biden's acting coach - who evidently specializes in LYING & goofy looking fake aggression with angry eyes! 
 @KevinMcGil Whoooooooooaaa, Nellie! :-) RT FOX News poll has Obama winning tonight's #debate by 70%. @barackobama @davidaxelrod @joenbc 
 Oi why are Americans so ignorant? I think Obama is better than any other past president 
 Only watched enough of the debate to form an intitial impression, basically Obama walked in like a pimp and ate that face. 
 Wait for the foreign policy debate.@stretch4444 I wish Romney had brought up the multitude of daily briefings missed by Obama ! 
 Michelle #Obama broke debate rules by cheering when moderator lied about #Libya to save Barack's butt. #MSMBias 
 @ItsEmaxSnitches Who will win, Obama or Romney? click @VotetoWin_2012 and follow the link in her description! 
 The #Obama legacy:  Bad Policies = Poor Results = Gloomy Future. Would you really rehire him to make sure this happens?#Romney 
 Students have been camping out all night to see Obama and more students are beginning to line up! 
 I'm not racist but Obama needs to remember that a white man built this land. A black man sold his families to the white man. 
 @AidanLicks but if you want government to have less power, Obama should be your biggest enemy 
 Mr. President please stop the cover up. You did not call it a terrorist attack until 2 weeks after the attack. We have the transcript @Obama 
 @GMA who wrote this? Badly worded question. Obama won. 
 Interesting, too, that President Obama called Mitty on his "Social Ideas"-- BECAUSE  SOCIAL = PEOPLE and NOT CORPORATIONS ! 
 Obama calls out on Romney about his investment on companies (Bain Capital) outsourcing American jobs to China (Sensata plant in Illinois)... 
 #debate Rose garden presidential statement (3:53 mark) Obama says "All Americans always.." clearly not talking specifically of Benghazi 
 @keder False statemen. Obama had 14, Mitt Romney had 2, Crowley had 1. Obama wins on falsehoods #debate2012 
 @jay33231 just listening to Obama talk and blatantly lie is enough to make me want to vomit over and over again 
 White folks treasure being considered an honorary member of an oppressed people. A Republican coworker voted Obama to keep his hood card. 
 Best thing about the debate? If Obama thinks he won the first, he'll have a similarly distorted impression of the second. 
 Yes, Barack Obama LIED last night. On September 12 he was blaming a video, not terrorism, for Libya. LIED. #mapoli 
 EVERY American knows lots of people who are out of work since Obama was elected. THAT will get him fired! 
 If Obama wins this election because of women's issues...I lose faith in my gender. #prolife #smallgovernment #RomneyRyan12 
 Obama26Obama Let's hope WHEN Obama is overturned, he ends up on welfare and food stamps. ) 
 Why is the media is claiming a win for Obama? Actually being awake this debate doesn't count. I like him even less, he acted like a jerk. 
 Obama SHOULDN'T have to keep reassuring his base after last night. Please let him speak2&secure the independent& undecideds w/out criticism 
 #debate If Obama had been telling the truth last night, he might have won.  America loses when a President lies to our face! #RomneyRyan 
 For a man with 4 years on the job, pres Obama seems to be very uncertain and lacking of conviction. 
 Great debate for Obama last night I gotta say title of one of my newest song is what went down and that is (I Don't Run From Nobody) 
 @GayPatriot Obama is answering questions from US Weekly followers today. Let's overwhelm him with tough questions! 
 Final proof Obama won the debate, #FoxNews is "raising questions" about  Candy Crowley as moderator. #p2 #topprog #tcot 
 truth-Obama failed on emigration reform,but the republicans did to-they never gave any help even when they got what they wanted. 
 Why did Romney say unemployment rates have gone up since Obama took office? Wasn't there that study last week that said they'd gone down? 
 According to him, I'm what's wrong with society because I think comparing Obama to Hitler is disgusting and makes no sense. 
 President Obama is worth 12million and has money over in china 
 .@AndrewRugg Predictably, the NYTimes and CNN have declared Obama the winner and those are the MSM headlines. 
 Obama lied about Libya and production of coal.  Obama claimed he has signed more permits  for coal. Not true, People in WV are unemployed 
 @whoisdemichael actually, when Obama was a senator, he proposed the bills & approved the plans that are responsible for our nation's debt. 
 @Daggy1 Obama didn't. Went straight into education. High end jobs. Prob there is. High end = low volume. We got that now in Ireland. 
 @DETECTIVE4LIFE @davidwebbshow yes, #Obama had rage in him, felt bad for man in audience who asked question. Out of control n too defensive 
 Don't live in America so it doesn't concern me but I want to see Obama lose just to see what Romney can do in 4 years 
 @SydneyREDtaylor I don't think either of them are talking about taking away financial aid but I do think Obama has helped with that a lot. 
 They just said "Obama has really been pounding hard" on the news, do they even listen to themselves when they talk? haha 
 @Semkae I guess u didn't read the links I sent u. Even conservatives like Krauthammer and Laura Ingraham said Obama won @omarilyas @chiume 
 Obama is gonna outsource low paying jobs (most of y'all) Create more High skilled jobs. (NONE of y'all) 
 Obama hits back in fiery debate: A more aggressive Barack Obama buries the memory of a poor first showing as he and challenger Mitt R... 
 Obama's #failingagenda is burying the middle class and hurting families! RT if you agree and read more from AFP Prez @TimPhillipsAFP!! 
 Obama cannot run on his record and 4 more years would be a repeat of 1st 4 years @DishFeed 
 All of the Obama supporters keep asking for specifics of Romney's plan. I'm just asking for Obama to present any bit of a plan. 
 @brad4rdr  Fox News says Romney won. Given their record of accuracy, we can be confident that Obama did. 
 Yes Obama is DESTROYING the MYTH of White genetic & intellectual Superiority and? @jawbreakerctc01 @REM63489 @bootyisyou @BarackObama TKCAL 
 Well just found out Obama used to be a pot head #blowingupintheovaloffice 
 The only thing I understand about politics is that I hate Obama #nohope 
 FTD is irking the hell outta me. Buy flowers ONCE, and they parked their asses in my inbox like Obama. 
 "@WSJ: According to polls of undecided voters, Barack Obama narrowly won last night's presidential #debate." A narrow win is still a win! 
 President Obama's little trips to Virginia are really cramping my flight plans. 
 @TheSlimmyMan @evalongoria How did Obama win! Please explain. He didn't answer a single question he was asked? 
 @emilyctamkin You'll never see them post something like, "Well Hugo Chavez endorsed Obama, so LOOK AT WHAT OBAMA'S VOTING BASE REPRESENTS." 
 Ultimate irony!!! @Chris_Moody Obama to crowd in Iowa: "I certainly don't think politicians should control the health care that you get." 
 Obama is losing the election based on his last 4 years of lack luster performance. He has a history now. VOTE #mitt2012 lets get jobs moving 
 "I consider it a part of my responsibility as president of the United States to fight against negative stereotypes of Islam." - Barack Obama 
 Enslaves people to the government just like what Obama wants to do in this country 
 I will soon. Just sat down for the 2016 Obama's America movie. 
 Romney doesn't have a five point plan, he has a one point plan - Obama ...That's right call his bullshit!  
 @ChicGrl427 @RepubGrlProbs I don't think Obama won, but I see your point. 
 Biden on debate last night: Obama showed himself as "a man of principle, a man of  gumption, with a steady hand and a clear vision." 
 Romney's history of hiring women from his binders is noteworthy, Obama's history of hiring from welfare list not so much.  Your choice. 
 & Yessss Obama won last night debate :) 
 @americasvoice  are Latinos Libs fucking insane?It's Obama policies which have resulted in record deportations&S-Comm of millions Mexicanos! 
 Anyone see the irony on the left proclaiming this big debate victory when Obama lied to pretend he was practically a conservative? #teaparty 
 Everybody taking about i love Obama,i love Romney and I'm like,I LOVE WEED!! 
 I hope BravoTV hosts a Real Presidents Reunion series with Romney and Obama after the election #debate 
 Obama doing a wonderful job. 
 "Governor Romney you don't have a 5 point plan, you have a 1 point plan" @BarackObama that was a good one. #Debates 
 @JoeBiden Obama won the debate by a landslide 
 @KeithMcCullough @daytrend  IF Obama won, it was with the help of the moderator. I call that cheating. 
 @cavuto I'm a small business owner and think Obama's policies are great. P.s stop reporting alleged attack as end the world! 
 @zanzerjewel Who will win, Obama or Romney? click the link in the profile of @VotetoWin_2012 to vote now 
 @washingtonpost have you dummies still not realized, as CNN has already said, that mitt Romney did not misstep. @BarackObama lied again 
 I'm voting for Obama. Even thought he did not fulfill all othe promises due to tough making decions he still helped us in some serious ways. 
 Obama have Teenagers watching the "Presidential Debate " ! He's the first President to do that! That's what you call  making CHANGES ! 
 And Obama is the savior who is going to bring world peace to the world. 
 @hardball James #Lipton to Chris #Matthews:America has a choice--does she want a president or a boss...and I mean a boss. #Obama #Romney 
 @EvaLongoria @NathanFillion you got to be kidding... Obama lies-When his lips are moving.  Should be tried for treason, impeached and jailed 
 Obama: you want some votes?  Legalize weed. Free boosie. Before Romney do it. 
 @JeffersonObama Well Obama is doomed bcz he will lose TX, AL and MS :( lol 
 @gretawire People are realizing what a failure Obama has been.Hopefully more will smarten up! 
 My aunty said she votin fa Mitt Romney , caus Obama be smoking too much caus his lips blk... Lmmfao ! 
 I find it very interesting that Obama criticizes Romney for having a large pension. I guess he thinks success is bad. That's the Obama way. 
 When they were talking about immigration, Romney called them "illegal." Obama called them "undocumented." It's the little things. 
 Key difference between Romney & President Obama is Romney talks about WHAT he's going to do while Obama talks about HOW he's going to do it. 
 I guess everybody i follow is voting for Obama,  cus everybody bad mouthing Romney lol 
 Too many people on the Obama bandwagon solely because he's black. 
 @Trollpecki I thought this was Romney v Obama, not Romney v Candy and Barry 
 Whats the Difference...between Obama and a Monkey..?The Monkey has smaller ears.LOOOOOOOOOOL.Nah I kid. But forreal..tho Fuck Politics. 
 Hey Obama! you export inflation to the world you dick! #YouHaveNoBrain 
 Obama wants to lower corporate tax rate? News to me... #debate 
 I believe the moderator is slightly favoring Obama #ohwell #notmad #heisthepresident 
 Obama questions Romney's commitment to women's health care, pointing to the Republican's vow to eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood. 
 @Jadore_Elidja @santi_41 Mr.pena I think you should go for Obama now. (Not that I'm anyone to say but after that, just sayin) 
 If you or ya folks ain't rich, and you got loans, yo ass need to be tryna vote for Obama 2 or 3 times! lol #SallieMaeAintNoHoe lmaoo 
 Is it bad that one of the reasons that I like Obama (in a politically unbiased way) is that he wears nice suits? #shallow 
 Romney great answer on foreign competition, Obama-there you go again, give me 4 more years & I'll do better next time, trust me 
 Obama only makes sense 
 To make this debate more interesting Obama just needs to start rapping  #justsaying 
 @ilaffalot Nah I think Romney's gunna throw a punch at Obama. It's getting heated! 
 Seriously... Obama is not going to bring up the 47 percent remark? 
 Just heard my dad say "Obama shut up"  hahaha. How bout we say fuck both these old dudes. Vote for real freedom#SamRussellForPresident 
 @TrIzZySpaCedOuT and if you were actually interested I would ask you to tell me the bad things Obama has done as president. 
 I think the only people stupid enough to vote for Obama again are the ones who can vote for the first time this year #smfh #getout #NObama12 
 Romney is getting drowned out by both Obama and Crowley! #debate 
 Ahaha did that mediator lady really just back up Obama and shit on Romney?! At a girl! 
 I wish I could just hug President Obama and tell him every little thing will be okay. 
 Obama is good if he got the tennage community watching this debate 
 No doubt #Obama has gotten more time to talk. Yet if #Romney goes over by a few seconds, the President gripes to #Candy. #Debate 
 Some black people our age may or may not vote for Obama, but MOST older black people out of school, working, or retired will vote for him. 
 According to Obama, Schools(gun free zones) are the answer to F&F. What a putz.  #2012debate 
 I'm at work. What did Obama do that made everyone lose their shit? 
 The press room busted out laughing when Obama said " my pension isnt as big as yours " LOL , Good comeback dawg ! 
 @DivaStateOvMind I don't even care about all of this forreal....but Obama won this one! lol....Kilt that perfect hair Mitt! lol 
 Every American that I follow is obviously impressed that Obama is president.. -___- 
 Obama says he believes in self reliance? What a joke! He believes in a nanny state! 
 #PresDebate There! Obama said it. The 47 percent. His closer. 
 And Democrats finally breathe as Obama says "47 percent" 
 Notice how Obama didn't need to be told to stop. 
 Much better Obama 
 Obama wins, hands down! #current2012 
 I just want Obama to read a bedtime story to me. I love listening to him speak. 
 Oh, so now Obama cares about the military? That's funny, wasn't he just photographed saluting Marines while on the phone? Right. #BS 
 Obama is so cute! :') I love him. 
 President Obama Is Great Man && He Deserves More Respect Then Romney Is Giving Him ! 
Obama is now pandering! Since when does he believe in free enterprise? 
 Yay President Obama did it hands down!!!! Yeah buddy 
 Obama kicked ass in this debate in my opinion. #debates 
 Black people make up a bunch of bullshit excuses to cover up the fact that they voting for Obama kuz he black lol that sh** be too hilarious 
 I will never stop loving watching the First Couple.  No one can ever say that Obama doesn't love his wife! #debate 
 Ughhh Obama's voice makes me cringe #youareannoying #idonotlikeyou 
 @JenGranholm Obama cool as the ice in my freezer cnt wait until the War Room tomorrow!! 
 Obama killed it man. Good job on proving that factual error by your opponent. I'm proud.  
 "And that's how you debate biatch" - President Obama as he looks at Romney and drops the mic and leaves the stage. #DNC2012 #GOP2012 #tcot 
 Obama's most important job is CINC. He failed in his mission with Benghazi. He lost. He should be fired. Everything else is window dressing. 
 Obama must have gotten really high oral marks in english when he was in highschool. Probably roasted the fuck out of everyone. 
 Classic all the moderators thus far have all been die hard liberals pulling for Obama and Mitt still wrecks him. 
 Romney asking Obama if he has funds offshore, Obama's face was like bitch I barely got funds inshore lol 
 @Ed @stevenportnoy @ABCNewsRadio I cant believe my ears!! What is wrong with people? They are so pro Obama they are def and blind 
 Wow! Great job Obama.What a comeback. Lol#PresidentialDebate 
 Or Obama or mit or big big bird or the economy or food stamps or the pell grant or jobs or education NOTHING!!! 
 Obama won that debate guys. 
 Obama won that shit! #TeamObama 
 I love how Obama threw out that he thinks his daughters should have the same opportunities as "anyone else's" sons.... 
 Great debate performance by President Obama! Much improved from last time 
 Obama won that #debate hands down!!! Vote @barackobama!!! 
 @MonicaBrown FYI 47 percent are ecstatic about President Obama's performance tonight Mitt Romney. Our President is the truth! 
 @Foobian no matter who the fuck our president is and I think that if Obama stays in office that things will get better eventually... 
 Everyone seems so close minded, either Obama or no one and that's it and that makes you ignorant, we need to know both sides 
 Obama - Same rudeness and arrogance that has been part and parcel of this presidency. Vote the bum out. 
 Very impressed with #Obama tonight. Much more engaged and prepared. No doubt about my vote #ObamaBiden2012 
 @zachbraff @donald_faison I just realized if you 2 had a baby, he'd probably look like Obama in 50 years.

 B. Clint training Obama haaaard on how to lie to the American ppl. And on facial expressions. 
 Well tonight Obama has something in common with the Yankee's. They're both losing. 
 Voting for #Obama im behind him a 1,000,000% 
 Obama always linked Benghazi to Cairo in order to link it with the video. He clearly did not call it a planned act or terrorism. 
 I want Obama b/c I look forward to my daughter growing up & saying, "Ugh. We don't have enough men on staff. Go get my binders full of men." 
 @AceofSpadesHQ @jaycosttws @michellemalkin @noltenc "No acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great nation..."-Pres. Obama

 @EmilyPurserSky Obama fought for his job last night and he may have convinced voters to give him another shot! @JCBua @SkyNews 
 @ChristiAnne67 wow...I think the left press has fooled you. Obama looks like a staunch conservative in comparison 
The fuck wrong wit us voting for obama cuz he black all them white people in the house let us fuckn live

To all the Obama voters, your Prez is acting like he has not been Prez for the last 4 yrs, talking abt what he plans to do with problems now 
Obama said he agrees w/ @MittRomney on lowering the corporate tax rate...really? Why haven't you done that in the last 4 yrs? #HofstraDebate 
A commitment I made when I was President Even Obama sees it in the past tense! #HofstraDebate 
@NerdRage42 no but it takes from the same program that Obama is jumping on Romney for wanting to cut funds 
Obama is definitly mad now lol 
most people don't like blacks ppl because we prove our ignorance. so they don't like Obama bc he looks like us. 
There you go..."Jobs are not coming back" -Obama 
Obama stop interupting you fucking pussy. Loose with some respect! 
Damn.. Obama just got his ass. Haha 
Romney makes good point in everything he's said Obama is coming up with every excuse to make himself look good 
Hope I get to duck hunt this season before Obama takes my guns #trymebitch 
Doesn't need to. CLASS>>RT @dkpbpost: RT @FranklyFlorida: Obama hasn't mentioned Mitt's 47 percent. Time is running out. #debate 
Obama REALLY shouldn't talk deficits. #debate 
Bye Diego RT @Diego_E85: I'm missin the debate but I Heard Obama jumped at Romney n Romney flinched. Obama bout that life #2Terms 
Ohhhhhhh Obama is too slick. 
Stop interrupting. It's not nice Obama! #liar #rude #sitdown 
Obama shutup you rude scumbag 
Dear, Obama you're not a hard ass! Sit down! "Some jobs are not going to comeback" this is what you want America no jobs?! Goodluck... 
Is it just me or is the debate moderator very biased for Obama #makeobamashutup 
Hey, Obama...corporations STILL don't pay taxes this week, or the next week, either...no matter how many ... http://t.co/h47o7XL5 
We need to bring jobs back Obama? You said you would do that 4 years ago...#debates 
I'm not even saying Obama just cause he's black but my future is at risk also. 
Candy gotta thang for Obama I promise. She be smiling when she ask Obama questions and she took up for him earlier 
I wish Obama would stop interrupting and actually answer the question asked not go on about something else #shutup #sitdown 
@AndyKindler Obama's, answer for everything, I killed Osama bin Laden. 
Something wrong, Obama? http://t.co/ER9ve4DQ 
@OlsonBayley I'M CATHOLIC! I support Obama because I care about my future! An you are being racist! Obama is black, but he is a good person! 
If governments don't create jobs then why is Romney blaming Obama for not creating enough of them? 
@Adam_Findlay Obama is a Christian 
Fuck Obama 
@seanhannity This is a great question for Romney to rebutt Obama's negative ads... 
AK-47's used in "gang banging", as Obama put it, are not purchased legally in the US.  Assault Rifle ban does not solve that prob. #Admend2 
The One Thing I Can Say And I Salute Obama For Is The Fact That He Has Remained HUMBLE Throughout This Entire Election And Debate . 
Weh him just seh? The whole time he's been trying to bash Obama, shut dat sxxt up!!! 
I think Obama's sincere #ilikehim 
Obama must take advantage of 47% now 
While Obama has been staying on topic and doing what he's suppose to be doing and that is... 
For the idyotsss complaining how Obama ain't get us out of debt why the fuck don't u tell ME what YOU'D do to fix the shit then? Hahn?! 
This moderator needs Obama to win so the government forces her to lose weight 
Obama looks foolish on the China issue! 
Sidenote: Obama's profile is sexy....Now back to the debate. 
Romney is an ignorant mofo!!! #TeamObama 
We're all children of the same God say ROmeny.  Except Obama.  He's the devil  #debates 
I hope Obama responds with "i didn't say you didn't care about 100% of the ppl. You did." 
So if government doesn't create job #mittswordsThen how is it Obama's fault there is no job growth 
if we gave Bush 8 years to fuck our shit, we give Obama 8 years to fix it. #TeamObama 
Same God? Obamacare? Did Romney suddenly switch sides? #debate 
OKAY when is Mitt Romney going to tell us what's HE'S going to do instead of what President Obama didn't do." 
It seem like Obama never really have time to make his point but Romney do ?? 
Y'all see how Obama actually explained to us what he PLANS to do for corporate tax rates. Romney still hasnt told us any of his plans yet... 
#nbcPolitics I looove how Romney is trashing Obama. #RomneyNation #Romney2012 
Romney Shut Yo Ass Up Mannnn#TeamObama 
We don't have to settle... ~Mitt Romney  #Obama2012 #debates 
Hell yes! He came through and punched DOWN! RT @TiaraSoBoojie: Do you guys feel like Obama reclaimed his victory with this debate?? 
Barack Obama, Shawn Carter, & Sean Combs have to be the COOLEST OLD' HEADS in the world! #TRUTH 
Obama just lying now. 
Obama can come to my house, I'll dye his hair and feed him tons of food. 
Romney is a genuinely nice guy. He has a great record in MASS. What does Obama have again? Oh, right. 
@ResCon1 Romney said Obama is responsible 4 the security failures that killed our pple in Libya,Obama said nothing.#theblaze2012 #debates 
@danielleverde lol @BarackObama got this in the bag! He was the president of debate at Harvard! This what he do! Romney is full of lies! 
@applejacks_hunt @joeymask1 Race has nothing to do with it I actually favored Obama against McCain..but everything he said was lies.. 
Obama needs to shut up, he made our economy shit 
Aaaand Romney is still an idiot. #NoSpecifics #CantAnswerHow #Obama2012 
Obama believes in risk takers being rewarded - except when the reward exceeds government mandated levels. #debates 
My grandparents think Obama is the antichrist 
Obama believes in Free Enterprise, but "everybody should have a fair shot" 
@Crystal_Wright That's right! In fact there are 900,00 AA female entrepreneurs in the US now who aren't dissatisfied with President Obama! 
Obama is now saying he is a republican. He is right that there needs to be more free market an less gov control. That's what republicans do 
If Obama is re-elected, I'm going to purchase my first gun.  End of story.  #RomneyRyan2012 
Obama: I believe Gov Romney's a good man #debate #classy 
Lmao President Obama just came for him. "I believe government creates jobs" Debate over. 
Obama is goin in right noww #hyfr 
LIE...Obama calls the private sector as the enemy. 
Obama better say tht ! Alrightttttt 
Obama: I believe that everybody should have a fair shot... Do their fair share... Play by the same rules. #NBCPolitics 
Check Mate President Obama! 
They both got good ideas but obama is the president we need to keep moving forward #Obama2012 
#winning Obama mentioned the 47%!! Wooooo! #debate 
47% is finally brought up by Obama. #Boom 
Obama sort of walked into that one. Romney said that all Obama does is attack him. Obama stands up and attacks him. 
#debate "there are some jobs that won't come back". Obama. Get off your ass and make corp. Taxes competative, and stop blocking anwar. 
Once again Obama is not answering the question 
LOL. Obama saved the best for the last. 47%. 
47 PERCENT. Obama runs with it. At last. #PrezDebate2 
DAYUMMM Obama hit Romney with that K-O punch at the end 
Obama is going all Biden on Romney's ass. 
I may be slightly biased as I really don't like the republican way of life - but I think Obama won the debate on substance #debates 
Obama has done nothing for vets but insult them. 
FINALLY! I knew he was saving it for the last! Obama mentions the 47%. #PMTdebate 
#Obama's literally putting me to sleep #townhalldebate 
Proud of Obama for reminding everyone of what Romney has said. #sorrynotsorry 
Oven Mitt is just destroying Obama #Bravo 
But Obama gets final word on 47% #fourmoreyears 
Obama won that ! 
The last 4 years didn't work out like Obama promised, it's time to move on and give Mitt Romney the chance to fix these mistakes #addebate2 
Obama did great! 
The only way I would vote for Obama is if he banded soccer from The United States . 
Obama's passionate last answer was worth watching this whole slugfest.  #OFA_VA #OFA #debate  Great job, Mr. President! 
Obama why does your 2min seem like forever? #blahblahblah 
#debates Obama wins! Slam dunk. 
Obama is the realist niqqa I watch on tv! 
Obama need to punch his ass real quick. 
Obama just *Tebowed* on his ass!!!! 
@TeamSID http://t.co/sBmoHkZu not so sure about that. Obama is a 64.4 percent favorite in the forecast 
Obama killed that one. Killed it. 
Obama 4 more years!!! 
Obama is just threw a verbal World Star Bus Driver Uppercut to end the #debate 
Obama did his thing tonight 
amazing finish to that debate President Obama, absolutely amazing 
Obama: "I believe in self-reliance." Mr. President, I'm sorry, but I rely on God. He wakes me up and I live for Him. #HowItWorks 
Way to close out Obama. Well done. 
I have no doubt in my mind that Obama won that debate 
I'm sorry but Obama killed it. #Debate2012 
Obama just went in for the kill with Romney's 47% comments.#winning #debate 
Once again, Obama get 4 more minutes 
Romney brings up the same points over and over again and tries to make them relevant. Obama brings up relevant points to answer questions. 
OMG Obama's closing was insanely great. WWII grandpa and GI Bill? Slam dunk. #debate 
Obama beasted tonight. 
@Angie_Jay: Way to end the debate Pres. Obama! *applause* #debates 
Mr. Obama, the only thing you've been fighting for is the use of my money! #2012debates 
Debate was really a verbal boxing match.. Obama won round 2! 
Solid 47% reference Obama. That really was a scumbag thing to say 
Romney 40:50 and Obama 44:04. Wonder how many times Obama and Crowley shouted Mitt down. 
Obama, you better save that 47% comment to close out your argument!!! 
Obama wins! 
Obama killed it 
President Obama *clap clap* 
Obama just 'sexual chocolated' Romney. 
Obama came with that uppercut tonite... 
I will be votin... Obama!!! 
Ahhhhh! Yesss Obama! That's how you close it out! #Obama2012 
It is an Obama night.very articulate and strong 
Obama won that one hands down 
Romney wants to ban porn.I bet half of you like Obama now. #banwagon 
The last question made Obama shine... 
Obama took this one...#GoBlackPeople 
Obama won that 
No question Obama blew this mf out like 140-18 tonight 
#OBAMA #VoteObama #IloveObama #NoMitt 
Obama won tonight. 
Obama definately won this debate! 
@KikiMonique_ Because the hoodrats don't know what or who a Romney and Obama are. 
Obama 
Yessss Obama won this 
Obama dropping the mic would've have been hilarious! 
Obama best do really well on the next one. 
Fox going into meltdown, Obama must've won #debates 
Gon head President Obama lol :) 
I hate political analyists sometimes, because they be making Obama look bad. 
President Obama signing autographs with that left hand. Yum!  So attractive! 
Obama Body Language again  - looking for his teleprompter and just rambling on 
Obama killed it. #fourmoreyears 
Yo wife is ugly Romney , she don't have nothing on the flawless Michelle Obama 
@FoCrealdoe Obama grew up in Hawaii. 
Obama won!!! #thatisall 
@Moniggyy People just like Obama cause he's black! #Racists #TeamRomney 
#debates Obama home run 
Anytime Obama talks about believing in America and Americans, I just don't believe it. 
#autograpgh Obama signing autograpghs like he is some rock star... give me a break. 
@LatinosMatter: #Obama MOPS THE FLOOR with #Mitt Romney!!!! Yes he did! 
Obama brought the grit tonight. I'm proud. 
Michelle Obama is one tall bitch! 
Very well played by Obama to save the 47% comments for last....great performance tonight, made me proud 
Obama won this! #handsdown 
What an intense, tension filled debate. Libya moment was deciding moment, Obama wins this one. Obama came to play tonight. #obama2012 
Bottom line, Romney did a great job tonight of reminding people of the failed Obama policies over the past 4 years. 
So Obama has a Morgan Freeman narrated commercial.  #itsover #hewins 
These people don't care, they just want pictures taken with Obama. 
Obama is doing the best he can for the mess of a country he got handed! #Obama2012 
Romney not even letting Obama talk 
@CadenHaynes because Obama is a beast. 
Obama Wins by a landslide! :) 
Exactly! RT"@CharlesMBlow: Obama saves "47%" for the last two minute so that Romney couldn't respond. #crafty #debate" 
Obama won this debate as soon at Romeny opened his mouth! 
Is it just me or did Obama's hair get whiter during the debate?...lol 
Of course Mr Obama waits to bring up 47% at the end when @MittRomney can't explain! Wow worried #potus? 
If Obama don't win this debate.......real Nigga shit......I'm gonna burn to house down. 
What's funny is, I think Mr. Romney did better this debate. Raising your voice and saying Obamacare a lot in first debate was not a victory. 
I'm pretty sure any president that took over after Bush would've had the same difficulties as Obama. Give him another four tears to fix it 
Obama verbally hit him with that uppercut. 
It was nice of Obama to show up for the debate this time. 
@Slate Obama won Romney got blitzed. Though I am voting for Obama I thought Romney won the first. 
Ig I'm the only one who doesn't like Obama. 
Thanks for showing up this time Obama, it's nice to have you back. #Obama2012 #forward 
Mitt and Obama are gonna go home and continued this debate on Skype 
Although romney didnt do as bad as obama in the 1st debate, I see it as 1-1 Obama won this round, next is boca raton. 
#debates Obama really clear winner 
My dad annoys me with how much he thinks Obama is like satan and evil. #chill #hesnotplottingtodestroytheuniverse 
@BarackObama just punch Romney in the. diiicck! 
@GaymerCon So Obama could sweep in and save the day. 
Did anyone notice Obama and his wife patting each others back? Really? 
Oops my husband just said Obama mopped the floor with this one! 
& u look like a non muthaf*ckin factor RT @realDonaldTrump: Obama is looking rhetorical and weak. @MittRomney is looking strong and sharp 
YObama so ratchet, he was bouta punch dat Romney nigga in the throat least 8 times 
@WSJ Obama won and he won Big!!! 
@CNBC2012 Obama may have won the battle but will he win the war?  4 more years of Obama is 4 more years of Failure. 
@ZainMotani Obama can free Boosie with a pardon at the end of his presidency. #wipemedown 
Mitt stuck his chin out and Obama punched it -Chris Matthews 
I hate that the reporters reporting after the debate are getting on President Obama! 
Obama took out the elite four with a metapod and no pokedex, they wouldn't even let Romney through the front door. 
What if Obama and Biden were able to tag team during the debate... 
He stuck his chin out and Obama punched him hard. #Obama2012 #debate 
#the debate is boring to watch after a while. I get tired of hearing Obama go ummm, ughhhh, and well actually... #anoying 
Amazing that Obama would seek to dodge Benghazi and Romney would let him. In the end, Obama said the buck stops with him. True statement... 
is Obama trying to debate about guns? he doesn't know a thing about guns and that's #fact 
@BenjaminWavey that sounded racist against my own race hahaha but I meant I'm team Obama. And yes! 
@gretawire I felt bad for Obama, he lost 2 debates .His record  looks bad. 
HA RT @SwinCash: #Welp President Obama hit em with the 47 percent like the UpperCut heard around the world.. Then drops the mic... *Tears* 
@Larrys_Bitch seeing as I'm canadian& don't know as much about america as you do, all I have to say is my family would be voting for Obama. 
@IChogan @Yo_Floyd Obama had more sense, less God. Simple fact. 
That debate was like Obama being the bus driver & Romney being that rude bitch. 
@papchuseyo Obama sucks... 
@BrettMineer: Obama needs to end on 47%! Just for fun! #hofdebate #Romney #Obama he did and very well too. 
Pres. Obama handled this debate much better than the first. 
Smart move by Obama waiting for the last word to directly address 47%. 
(President) - Barack Obama killed it tonight, lets do our parts and keep him in office if you truly support him #Obama2012 
Mane I'm in the process of trying to get rich...everybody PLEASE vote for Obama #SelfishTweet lol 
Obama won that debate easily.  As a woman Romney was so offensive. 
Mamas dont let your babies grow up to be Obama, let em pick guitars and drive them ol trucks cause cowboys have manners they don't interrupt 
I don't think Romney was as terrible as Obama was in the first debate. But it sure felt like he got whupped. 
this. RT @_FrenisWorld_: Ok Obama clearly won. Now go to Fox and they'll say Romney won and the moderator was wrong for interrupting Romney. 
Obama clearly won that debate 
Obama again speaks about four minutes longer than Romney. 
Obama shat on Romney. 
@CNBC2012 Moderator Candy Crowley is biased!!! You dont interupt Romney so Obama can speak. She shouldnt be allowed to vote!!!! 
Yes, it's hard to change a country in 4 years. But Obama knew that when he promised he would do it... And he didn't. 
I would say Obama killed it in that one!Obama and Biden: 2Romney and Ryan: 1 
Obama Won This Debate . 
#hofdebate all the hard work and sacrifice of the Hofstra community and Obama didn't even have the courtesy of acknowledging where he was! 
Obama got the trap niggas, hood niggas, twerkers, hoes, dope boys, & weed smokers watching the debate. Name one president who has done that? 
Wow Michelle Obama was just in Chapel Hill, now she's at the debate. #SheFlyin 
@GMA @ThisWeekABC @GStephanopoulos - I hope y'all won't miss and/or dodge the fact that (a) #Obama LIED and (b) Candy ran interference. 
@johncerisola The only reason teenagers like Obama is cause he's black and everyone thinks he's cool and like you just said a thug. Like no. 
Stfu. RT @realDonaldTrump: Such long rhetorical and boring answers from Obama. No wonder nothing gets done. 
@Evan_Sofa so is Obama but you don't see him bragging about it 
Obama won !!!  Send Romny back home 
when Obama can't answer a question, he has the moderator save him by changing the subject. 
Obama killed itttt. 
#debates Obama knows what is needed for this country. Romney is just gonna screw things up by putting his foot in his mouth! 
Obama delivered a.bis driver uppercut. Boom!! #debate 
Obama exceeded expectations, a low bar set by the last debate, yet he still loses. He's shared no vision for what he'd do w/ 4 more years. 
Comparing Obama & Romney's financial aid policies - http://t.co/lS158tgk 
I unfollowed her ass for saying team Obama. #thatshitstopstoday 
Final minute breakdown for debate: Pres Obama at 43:57, Romney at 40:58 minutes. 
Obama is the definition of #Clutch 
You fail to realize that Obama is not from the hood. In the hood, your life will suck no matter who the president is. 
I think the moment when Obama really showed he was serious was when the Libya subject came up. He took over with fire in his eyes 
It's amazing how Romney criticizes @BarackObama  for what he didn't do but his plans will take 5-8 years to see real change. #NOT BACKWARDS! 
Good win Obama!! Well won!! #Easy 
"Aggressiveness" is not in Obama's character so it seemed misplaced #butthatsjustmethough 
@DYANCASTILLEJO Obama, I feel his sincerity. 
Obama better give that black guy a hamburger, so he will vote for him again 
Obama once again murdered Romney in the Debate Tonight !! #Obama2012 
Our viewing party room thinks Obama won this debate. How about you? 
Approx Time period: Obama had 43:57. Romney had 40:48. Romney with the win! 
Libya issue seemed to be one of the most significant parts of debate... Interesting how Obama owned up to incident after Hillary's comments 
Ron Paul could blow both Obama and Romney out of the water in this debate. #nobandwagoner 
I really just don't like Obama 
Obama was on point. Engaged and strong. Mitt seemed arrogant. 
Wether some want to admit it or not, some people just are going to vote for Obama just because he is black. SOME not all 
@DevinSullivan21 Obama gon beat yo ass ! 
Obama won that debate !! 
Rt ha truth"@HURTJR: When Obama speak.. I listen carefully, when Romney speak i check my twitter, Facebook, Instagram and scratch my ass" 
Obama won http://t.co/AqChYUTK via @MarketWatch 
@CallMeGrayy true, but the policies Obama has in place haven't worked and he plans to continue them 
@dannyajasso I don't know, the Libya question and getting fact-checked from Candy was a big moment to me like Obama's tone 2 wks ago. 
Obama should have dropped the mic after that final statement. He completely owned it !! 
Great moderation from Candy Crowley. Mitt seemed cranky and exasperated but President Obama was on point and intolerant of bullshit. #debate 
Sheesh RT @ColbyMarkel: Michelle Obama should give Colb that mouth 
Fuck you if your not voting for Obama!! 
Yeah. So i think Obama won this debate. 
Contentious, but one is telling the truth and the other is lying. Obama=liar. Romney=truth. 
I know y'all won't agree, but I don't care because I love my God. I really think Obama isn't following Him at all and that's the main reason 
Obama won that debate hands down. 
Obama ended with a knockout. The 47% comment = the bus driver uppercut! Dont try to explain, Mittens. Just get off the bus!! #POW! #fb 
If to win this debate is to tell the most lies, then Obama won. #townhalldebate 
Obama basically made Romney his Bitch! 
#TeamBarack Maddow: "probably, I think, the best debate of Barack Obama's career as a national politician. 
How Barack Obama Won The Presidential Debate http://t.co/GMgWS4s9 businessinsider 
Obama Is Gonna Kill 
#Obama clearly won Big time tonight! 
Obama gave him the TKO with 47%!!!!! 
RT@BarackObama  #RomneyExposed @politicalwire That exchange on Libya was Romney's Gerald Ford moment He was lost and not presidential at all 
Romney should have just gone over and just kicked Obama in the shin....lol!! 
I don't like Obama. But I voted for him. Because, look at the alternative. #Yikes 
Ima start telling people vote for the white side of Obama 
Sexual chocolate !! RT @Ravens_Examiner: Drop the mic Obama.......DROP THE MIC!!!! 
@ChemicalAT Obama nailed the Libya question! 
I spoke in tandem with Obama on his talking points.  He's not saying anything new 
So that was considered the most remarkable date EVER in history??? And Obama won?? CHECKMATE!! 
Obama got more time, but we all gained more from Romney. #qualityoverquantity #debate 
Superbowl pick : Obama will win. 
@ChaseCagle Okay?  Do you want to give me some examples of what good has come to our economy since Obama has been office? 
Obama 2-0 despite the haters! 
SOOEY!  The moderator fact checking was wrong about Obama and Benghazi ... Romney had it right all along! 
@FillWerrell: Wanna hear a joke? Barack Obama. Or politics in general... 
Obama 2012 . 
President Obama on points if for no other reason than he knocked that stupid smirk off Mitt's mug. 
Obama be killin' this economy! #RANTTWEET #cantstandhim 
@RickeySmiley Obama was on topic tonight I think Obama recovered from the first debate, but Romney mad an donkey of himself tonight. 
Obama took this one easy. So Obama/Biden 2 - Romney/Ryan 1 
Dude, Obama brought it tonight. This is the man who should have been here in the first debate 
@chrisrockoz: Mitt Romney: I can't decide which thing Obama did was worse, giving everyone healthcare or saving the auto industry. 
@adammott23 Obama is clearly winning! 
Even though I'm biased, I'm calling this for Romney, but just barely.  Fact checks will show Obama a liar. #tcot #RomneyRyan2012 #debate 
President Obama got this! My TL told me so!!! 
the fact that Obama mentioned Nassau Community College just shows how much he actually cares about this country. LI all the way 
Tonight Obama fought fire with fire but in his cool,  controlled way which makes it much more effective #debate 
Obama needed the moderator to bail him out and also called a man named Kerry "Kerr". lol 
Debate: we are in trouble no matter which way we go , give Obama 4 more years. 
Obama is killed it tonight I'm so proud of him 
Yes. Obama won. Yes. 
@nickmatthew Obama wins 7-6,4-6,7-5,6-3 
@ConservativeBro I think Romney won,because Obama told several outright lies,that everyone know were lies.Same ol' same ol. 
@iamdiddy revise the question "Hell yeah Obama won the Debate!!!! 
Women for Obama !! http://t.co/wk96oBYY 
Obama was clear on his plans. Education. Taxation. Industry. Families. #Debate2012

Obama sent nudes to Romney's wife. 
Obama fyed that ass up tonight ! #2012PresidentialDebate 
@kirstenpowers10 Amazing Obama actually answered a question. 
Obama did work . 
If Obama did mess up this debate, I couldn't tell. He's just that smooth... 
#Obama won that one for sure. #Romney couldn't answer a question without going on the attack. Changed my opinion, Romney is disrespectful! 
Obama bothers me...please stop talking about how great he is. 
Obama for player the year 
Obama gots this! La raza is behind you! 
CNN not trying to let Obama be great 
Romney should wear a best made of gay porn magazines to throw off Obama next time. 
Obama interrupted romney like "hol' up hol' up woah dere my nigga" 
I believe that President Romney will be far worse for USA and the world than George W Bush. Vote #Obama #2012debates 
No one is voting for Obama because he is black I swear to God y'all are so STUPID 
They just confirmed Obama DID NOT verify Libya as a "act of terror" it was 2 weeks 
Obama won woop woop woop woop 
Alright Obama...Get the hell out of here. pronto! 
Obama could have easily have said GOML to romney. Obama with the win 
@cedriclabonte Mitt Romney did it (create jobs, balanced budgets and Business turnaround). Obama not. 
Obama killed it haha 
@HeyImDiamond_ girl she pissed me off and she was saying Obama grandparents were rich and other stuff 
Mitt, why didn't you just go up and punch Obama straight in the face? 
@EmmMacfarlane: Ari Fleischer calls it a flat-out draw"... which means you know what..." Ya. Obama just went Honduras on Romney. #CMNT 
Poor Obama felt offended.  He is not used to having to answer for the truth! #debates 
President Obama hit Mitt with an ole fashion Cleveland Uppercut!!! 
Haha I didn't even know Obama has been president for 4 years already.. 
When Obama speaks, you hear the passion in his voice. When Romney speaks, you hear lies. 
Obama Gets His Swagger Back With A Strong Debate Performance Against Romney http://t.co/8Vcv6Eoq #Debate 
@BBCWorld Stronger #Obama but not enough to be a clear winner. 
@SammyRose7 omg she is so obviously biased! It was not fair at all she was consistently helping Obama! I'm so mad 
@TalkMMA he sucked big time if call it a KO for Obama 
Obama and Romney are both terrible candidates, but Romney is less worse 
Obama.. sorry but I cant vote for you.. unfortunately I'm Canadian 
My grandma said she bout to drop a "g" on Obama!!! Dam wish she could drop it on me!!!! 
Obama could not defend his indefensible record.  #debates 
Gotta say it.....I Love Obama!S/o to all the students who have to write about this Debate and turn it in tomorrow! Go head & knock it out 
@markknoller she was too busy interrupting Romney and trying to help Obama to get rolled. She let O have 4 minutes longer that R. 
Obama got 4 more mins because he kept cutting him off,# Donna Brazile is so stupid 
Half of u niggas only like Obama because he black thats why McCain lost and that's why Romney gone lose 
Obama +4... Th@'s w@'s up!!! Yeah yeah!!! 
@spaceghostturrt okay... Sooo that means we should just let Obama keep fuckin us up? Pretty sure he tripled our dept. 
I Have No Worries, I Know Obama Gonna Win. 
Nigga just vote for Obama!!!!! 
Obama said chill he got this!!!!!!! 
People don't even know what Obama doing for us they just saying vote for him cause he black. 
Bottom line, Obama's policies have failed for 4 years &, if reelected, there is no reason to expect anything different over the next 4 years 
Thank you, President Obama. You speak for me. 
Obama needs a vacation. 
My take on debate: Obama did better than last debate, but not good enough. Romney held his own. Both had hits & misses, but Romney won. 
Vote for Obama, not just for you but for yo mama! 
Obama suuucks. 
@aidanot34 I vote Obama cause I ain't about the abusive life 
Y'all dont understand....if Obama don't win...our lives are SHIT 
Obama's best performance. a strong commander and chief... 
I'm very pleased with President Obama and how he conducted himself at the debate. Job well done! 
@FightForJobs: Obama says he's kept commitments he's made. Agree/Disagree? #FightForJobsdisagree 
@BeirutToJupiter Yeah I saw that :) the content of what Romney was saying seemed more prepared than Obama. The Pres. prob. had a busier day. 
Last political tweet: don't act like ONLY Obama tries to change the subject on questions asked, Mitt does it too. THEY ALL DO IT. #fact 
That debate got heated! Romney almost brought the Chicago out of Obama. I bet he has a cigarette when he gets out of there! Romney, a xanax. 
@FredCuellar You're kidding!...CNN declares Obama the winner??...groundbreaking. 
@BarackObama snuffed Mitt Romney tonight #Forward2012 
Obama= broken promises. Romney= evidence of promises fulfilled.#reliability #Romney2012 
@BarackObama: President Obama: I said I would end the war in Iraq, and I did." #PromiseKept" 
And 4 years later.......... Obama has yet to put on his working boots. How do u lie to get into office and not do anything unsaid u would 
@ABC Your too bias for Obama. So it doesn't matter what you request. 
I'm waiting for Obama to uppercut Romney. 
#R_E_T_W_E_E_T for Obama .. Favorite for Romney !!! 
Iv never really been into politics..but im thinking about voting this year..jus to try and help keep Obama out of office. 
Dam right Obama 
Everyone always talking bad about Obama I mean I am not saying he is doing good but I don't see him doing anything bad!!! 
Obama can't get mad but Romney can? 
@ellencarmichael @mittromney Even more disturbing, seemed like Candy set up every topic to leave last word to Obama 
#Obama is desperate to keep his job as Vacationer In Chief. Lies, lies, lies. #RomneyRyan2012 #GOP2012 #Vote 
Obama is the reason why half of the people around me are even talking about politics now.I'd vote 4 him for that alone #Interesting 
It's gonna be a good night my Redskins won Sunday an Obama won tonight great night 
From 2009-11, the Obama years, oil production rose two of three years, for a net increase of 10.6 percent 
@JJtheKid30 with Obama as president, hardworking families like ours are being taken from and given to people who dont deserve it 
@crowleyCNN You are an embarrassment. Why'd you help Obama out so much? How'd you get to be a moderator? 
@KarlRove @cnn What a shock! A moderator gives Obama more time. It's just shameful 
This was nothing close to a Tie....Obama won this one. 
@jahollabackgirl Obama was being so rude! She was just doing her job! 
told my dad that I think Obama is hot just to see his reaction #hilarious 
When Romney told Obama to "check your pension," every American under the age of 30 said, "What's a pension?" 
I thought Obama was about to punch Romney for a minute. 
& Obama wins! 
Obama lied, Candy... screw it, she lied. http://t.co/ECXVygte

@umairh Romney this second debate. Cleaned Obama's clock. 
This debate was much better. Obama came out swinging as expected. He set the record straight 
The South side Chicago! president came out tonight!! Team Obama! 
So suddenly people like Obama..strange.. #nothankyou #RomneyRyan2012 
@MsTerryMcMillan Four more years with President Obama....Yes we can! 
Romney lost this as badly as Obama did the first, but the right wing hacks won't cry and moan.  That's how they win. 
Just so everyone knows, Obama called the attack an act of terror. #NoShitRomney #youlookstupid 
Obama for president 
Real talk Obama makes a lot of good point in which I believe in. 
Republicans are complaining about talk times and criticizing the moderator. Obama won 
I'm not interested in neither party but as far as this election go I do hope Obama wins but this whole shit is ... http://t.co/oeiiuYDF 
@mckenna95 and Romney was? Somehow he got from immigration to Obama's pension... 
GOP is gonna say that Mitt won and Candy showed bias toward Obama. #Debate2012 
Soledad O'Brien needs to start wearing Obama buttons. 
Do I have mostly democratic followers, or is the general consensus that Obama won the #debates? 
@sarahmcsimmons I'm a Democrat and can't wait to vote for Mitt, I only need a few words. The #Obama years have been a failure-he's FIRED! 
I was curious abt the numbers  http://t.co/BAXYGiza President Obama had about 44:04 minutes; Governor Romney had about 40:50 minutes; 
#LT Romney did what he set out to do stand firm solidifying his points and attack Obama's weaknesses 
Thank. God. Media saying Obama won...in Canada, anyways #PresidentialDebate 
Listening to tonight's debate on the radio, President Obama was strong and confident, Governor Romney sounded shifty. I'll vote #Obama 
Eckkk.. I strongly dislike Obama. #teamromney 
Great night for President Obama. Now let's get to work and win this election! #teamobama 
i'm sorry, nope. don't even need to watch the rest. Romney lost debate when Obama got a laugh about gasoline 
Obama had some good points tonight! 
@AndrewSheldon I just think he has a lot more experience than Obama and knows what works and what doesn't. 
@TeamRomney @BarackObama This is bullshit, Team Romney, and you know it. #obamaorbust 
Some people sreiously support Obama blindly. I'm going to sleep. 
Obama is left-handed. I like left-handed people. Lol 
Wish Romney would have reminded Obama about his "You didn't build that" comment when he lied about wanting 2 reward people's success #debate 
My face when I heard Obama won the debate. Pfffft. Sure. http://t.co/rtIshRqC 
I don't like Obama. #hateonit 
I guess Obama "sucked" cuz he wasnt rude like Romney.

@JedediahBila. Obama cranky angry all night did you see his eyes. Yikes. 
@BarackObama Couldn't be more proud of Obama! 
I fear for this country if Obama gets reelected... I seriously do :( 
"Obama put us in bad positions these four years" and bush put us in bad positions for 8 and you voted for him twice. 
Obama must have taken lessons from Biden recently #pdslive #debate 
I don't want either Obama or Romney to be our next President. But since one has to win, it better be Obama so I can get fucking married. 
1,000+ for Obama and about 900 for Romney. SUCK IT. HARD. #Obamaizdashit #Romneykissmydick #rhymingforthaelection 
@KurtSchlichter @hughhewitt @camedwards @camandcompany Obama wants to ban assault weapons and has done his part by shipping them to Mexico. 
What President Obama did on Romney was an "Act of Terror". 
Lying is an integral part of Obama's character. He's hopeless. #debate 
Obama should piss on Rammey ! 
I just decided who I'm voting for. Well done Obama #debate #debate2012

But Obama is no different from all the other US presidents as far as policies go,they all about war & lots of injustices. 
@danful38 And Obama said failed policy's of Bush, caused the gas to be low.  Well I guess Obama's failed policy's have let it rise, lol 
Geraldo declares Obama winner by a moustache hair. #debate 
Romney did two silly passes to Obama 1. on Libya and the other on 47% which made Obama closing statement stunning and winning. 
There's still another debate so Im not worried about proclaiming a winner. But Obama realy should seal this w/ Foreign Issues next. 
Romney: Calm, assertive, presidential. Obama: Angry, aggressive, non-presidential. #debate 
Only saw part of the #debate tonight, but am glad to say sounds like Obama brought his game this go round. 
@Big_Ohhhhh and yes the economy is still bad, due to bush or not Obama has not bad it one bit better and all the more worse than it was.

Obama for president. Case closed 
@MyName_JohnJohn heck no! I'm with Obama! 
Obama has more twitter followers than Romney ;D ctfu !! 
Obama Didn't Fix Our Falling Economy Because The Congress Was Very Republican So They Don't Follow What He Proposes . 
On FOX News: "Obama hasn't delivered anything...he's been bullsh*tting on everything." Oops. Danger of live TV. 
i feel like tonight during the debate i didn't learn anything about Obama's plan if he wins the election.... #awk 
Obama should regain the lead from his performance tonight. Romney looked desperate. 
In my opinIon Obama has already won . #sorrynotsorry . 
@BarackObama OBAMA WINS!! Follow meeee please sir :) You'll win! #ForSure 
Obama finished with a knock out talking about the 47%!!!! #greatfinish #Debate2012

I'm tired of all these "Romney don't know the struggle" tweets. President Obama went to private school. He didn't really "struggle" 
Romney, show your tax statements and i might listen to the bullshit leaking from your filthy sewer. Obama, crush that fucker. 
Obama said next term he wants to bring back the assault weapons ban no wonder he didn't get the NRA's endorsment
