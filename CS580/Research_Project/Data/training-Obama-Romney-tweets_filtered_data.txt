<e>Obama</e> dominated that debate... 
The fact that this debate will be recapped by Libya is not great for <e>Obama</e>. 
<e>Obama</e> definitely secured the illegal immigrant vote. 
<e>Obama</e> drones on and says nothing 
<e>Obama</e> gave more guns to Mexican drug cartels than he did the consulate staff in Benghazi, so there's that. 
Tonight <e>Barack</e> showed, as he has every day as president, that he’ll fight to ensure everyone has a fair shot at the American Dream. –mo 
You can combine the speaking skills of Churchill, Reagan, and Lincoln, and President <e>Obama</e> could still not defend his own record. 
Weird, <e>Obama</e> came across as bitter and clingy. #jerk 
<e>Obama</e> would be more convincing if he weren't the incumbent. He keeps talking like he just started last month. 
<e>Obama</e> says "I'm gonna do this this and this" but why hasn't he done it yet? What happened to doing that these past 4 years? #stepup #Debates 
My take on <e>Obama</e> tonight: "There is <a>nothing worse than aggressive stupidity</a>."- von Goethe 
Big, Angry<e>Obama</e> just came off as <a>unnatural, uneasy and uncomfortable</a>. I think it made him look sour and mean. #debates 
Maybe I missed it, but did President<e>Obama</e> go another full debate without outlining his plan for next four years? #debate 
President <e>Obama</e> 100% - Very, very obvious.  "Binders of women"? - I don't think so! 
We're a little off-topic, here. --<e>Obama</e> when he got caught with Chinese investments. 
So the government doesn't create jobs, but it's <e>Obama</e>'s <a>fault</a> for not creating jobs? 
If you can not beat them, then<a> lie</a> lie lie to the American people and hope they are to stupid to fact check and care. #<e>Obama</e> 
Me voting for <e>Obama</e> would be like me running my head into a wall, over and over and over and over! 
I find it revealing few people even comment on, much less get troubled by, <e>Obama</e> talking about "<a>hunting people down</a>" like he's a T-1000 
I really would like to tweet my opinion on the debate tonight but I don't think I could fit it into 140 characters how ridiculous <e>Obama</e> is. 
If <e>Obama</e> is here... who's running hell? #SHFL 
<e>Obama</e>killed it tonight. Absolutely killed it. If i believed any of it I would vote for him. But such an improvement. 
★ President<e>Obama</e> is <a>controlling this debate completely</a>. This is remarkable to be seeing this. #nbcpolitics #History ★ 
<e>Obama</e>promised so much last time and didn't do anything so Im confused as to why everyone believes him this time. 
<e>Obama</e> put more border patrol agents on border.... then gave Mexican drug cartels guns to shoot them with. 
<e>Obama</e> is what we need for a <a>steady, permanent improvement in our country</a>. Y'all already know who I'll be voting for. #fuckmitt #Obama2012 
Let's be clear: <e>Obama</e>is no <a>great friend to immigrants and brown people </a>around the world. #debate 
Our <a>economy has raised 17% in the last four years</a>,<e>Obama</e> made something out of nothing 
I truthfully can't stand listening to <e>Obama</e>.. He hasn't done anything to get us out of debt so why the heck  would you vote for him 
<e>Obama</e> got more<a> immigrants out of here </a>than any other president. 
If <e>Obama</e>were an ice-cream flavor, it would probably taste like bad decisions.🍦😂 
My mom was a single mom <e>Obama</e> that doesn't make you a female in the workplace 
Eeeewwww <e>Obama</e>'s fingers are so long... 
I think <e>Obama</e> has a blinking problem. #presidentialdebate2012 
<e>Obama</e> is by far the better choice, I honestly believe both of them aren't all that great but we're better off with<e>Obama</e> 
<e>Obama</e> should pay attention.  Had to ask name again.  Really? 
<e>Obama</e>stop taking bin ladins credit. The cia and bush admin has been working on it for years and all you do is say "shoot him" @FoxNews 
Yes <e>Obama</e> you have done everything that you can...WHICH HAS BEEN NOTHING!!! 
<e>Obama</e> is LITERALLY choking!! 
<e>Obama</e> deported my grandma 
Never thought I'd say this but I really hope <e>Obama</e> gets reelected 
I'm a firm believer of<e>Obama</e>'s slogan. We need to CHANGE the current president. 
Q. How can<e>Obama</e> improve the economy? A. Lose the election. 
<e>Obama</e> dropped the ball on the Benghazi attack. Fact 
<e>Obama</e><a> did awesome tonight</a>! I live my president! Great job! #obamabiden2012 four more years! ❤💙☺ 
President<e>Obama</e> im proud of you :) you are more fit to run this country and me and my family are supporting you 100 percent! @BarackObama 
President <e>Obama</e> brought it home  #fourmoreyears 
<e>Obama</e> really wants us to have an education :) 
<e>Obama</e> won this one on style, substance, facts and character! 
This is My President. Mr. President <e>Obama</e>. This is the man that has done all he can to get this country back on track. Let's give him 4 more 
<e>Obama</e> you had four years and shit has not changed like it was said to. So therefor you don't deserve another four. 
<e>Obama</e> Cant run on his record due to the fact of<a> all the failures</a> 
Wow... Is Everyone really going to be fooled by <e>Obama</e> again?? What good has he done for us in the last 4 years.. 
Meanwhile <e>Obama</e>sounded very confident telling a bunch of <a>bald-faced lies</a>. #debate 
When<e>Obama</e><a> didn't say anything about God</a>, that really bothered me... 
SherriEShepherd loved that President<e>Obama</e> ended with the 47% comment. Very effective. 
first,<e>Obama</e>- I hate to tell you this, but you had nothing to do with killing Osama Bin Laden! 
<e>Obama</e> takes way to much credit for killing Osama Bin Laden. I'm pretty sure that was the navy seals. 
Not even close. A complete reversal from the first debate, <e>Obama</e> winning on every level.<a> Audience connection, emotional appeals, facts</a>. 
Did <e>Obama</e> even do anything his last term that actually benefited America sufficiently? 
 OMG! What a guy. ---> <e>Obama</e> has taxpayers <a>funding</a> <a>graduate programs</a> in Uganda http://t.co/c1MwV375 
 <e>Obama<e> was mentored by a <a>communist</a> for eight years. Shows where his strong holds are. 
 <e>Obama</e> has now been in the <a>longest presidential campaign</a> ever (08) and now the <a>most expensive</a>. Interested to see what happens in 2016. 
 <a>Ohio</a> will be the ONLY state where <e>Obama</e> will <a>improve</a> from 2008 (according to RCP averages).

#<e>Obama</e> saves the best for last. Brings up <a>47% remark</a> at the end of the <a>debate</a>. Last thing everyone hears. He slams #MittTheTwit! #debate2012 
Yeah <e>Obama</e> never called it a terrorist attack in the rose garden. Called it an "attack" that's pretty broad Barack 
I love the love the <e>Obama</e>'s <a>show</a> for each other ðŸ‘« 
Yes, first lady Michelle <e>Obama</e> is always <a>on point</a>. 
â€œ@blakeburkett: If <e>Obama</e> is re-elected, I'm going to purchase my first gun.  End of story.  #<e>Romney</e>Ryan2012â€ Amen! 
<e>Obama</e>!! 
<e>Obama</e> <a>spoke</a> more than 3 minutes longer than <e>Romney</e> tonight #debates 
@SuzBrockmann I feel like that was just a game of Mortal Kombat, and when <e>Obama</e> said 47% the words "finish him" came on my screen. 
<a>Close debate</a>, but I think <e>Obama</e> took it. 
This was a great <a>debate</a>! Good job <e>Obama</e>! 
Now that's the assertiveness I <a>want to see</a> from President <e>Obama</e>. 
President #<e>Obama</e> was better, he was more specific, confident. MSNBC it might be easily considered <e>Obama</e>'s best <a>debate</a> performance. 
Hempstead brought out the aggression in <e>Obama</e> 
Clear <a>victory</a> for President <e>Obama</e> 
Number one reason I hate <e>Obama</e>? Because <a>killing</a> a child should never be legal, even if you consider it just a 'group of cells'. 
@DakodawithaD: Man. I'm amazed how much of a liar, fake and moron <e>Obama</e> is. He has really <a>outdone himself</a>. #debates  #<e>Romney</e>ftw 
Clear <a>victory</a> for Pres <e>Obama</e> to this debate. :) ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽŠ 
<e>Obama</e> went for the kill tonight 
To me who won the <a>debate </a>is #<e>Obama</e> yall already know don't care what nobody say 
Wow, <e>Obama</e> did <a>phenomenally</a>. 
<e>Obama</e> did lie about the <a>Arizona immigration model</a> success reference though. 
Bring jobs back! :O #<e>Obama</e> 
<e>Obama</e> was a force of nature on this <a>debate</a> 
One,<a> mistake </a>compared to 20 million <e>Obama</e> has already made! 
<e>Obama</e> won tonight 
You have got to be kidding.<a> Decisive</a> win for <e>Obama</e>??????? 
@komonews #debates both did well, but <e>Obama</e> was <a>solid</a>! 
If <a>convicted felons</a> could vote it would be ah #LandSlide for <e>Obama</e>.. #TruuuStory 
Just because I don't vote for <e>Obama</e> doesn't make me<a> racist</a>. The fact that you vote for him because he's black kinda does. 
And <a>debate number 2</a> goes to Barack <e>Obama</e>! #4MoreYears 
<e>Obama</e> won this <a>debate</a>. He was in total control. 
<e>Obama</e> believes in fairness, not ingenuity and hardwork. 
If <a>democracy</a> represents little more than a WWE Slam, then President <e>Obama</e> played the<a> role</a> of the Big Boss Man #Debate2012 
You can say <e>Obama</e> is all talk and no play but his views are for the greatest <a>middle class</a> via <a>education</a>. He is better for america #<e>Obama</e>2012 
I give <e>Obama</e> a pat on the back for his ,a>patience</a>.#NBCpolitics 
<e>Obama</e> is Like Kobe in the 4th quarter. 
Looking at the first <a>debate</a>, <e>Obama</e> looks like the nice guy whoâ€™s been pushed too far. #debate 
<a>Vote</a> <e>Obama</e> or don't vote ! #RS 
<e>Obama</e> hit that 47%! Tell em! #<a>Team<e>Obama</e></a> 
@Greytdog @kate_sheppard @DavidCornDC  I don't think anyone cares about the<a>47%</a>, everyone cares about what <e>Obama</e> didn't do :P 
Why did <e>Obama</e> have a talking time 3 minutes longer than <e>Romney</e>'s? #CNNdebate 
<e>Obama</e> !!!!!! 
@FoxFriendsFirst <e>Obama</e> won #<a>debate</a> hands down 
<e>Obama</e> got bounce in the instagram pic i just posted, he got my vote 
No acts of #terror will ever shake the <a>resolve of this nation</a>. The only time <e>Obama</e> he said the word terror in the #RoseGarden. About #Lybia 
<e>Obama</e> you have<a> my vote</a>. 
Pres <e>Obama</e> loud and clear let you <a>know</a> he is "The President of The United States" #<e>Obama</e>2012 #dems 
#<e>Obama</e> took this <a>debate</a>, came out swinging and never stopped 
Sorry guys, four more years of <e>Obama</e> is going to go much like the last four. No where but down. 
#AboutDamnTime RT @rweingarten: <e>Obama</e> was awesome <a>tonite</a>- Presidential while taking no prisoners #debate

#nbcpolitics as a female college student about to graduate <e>Obama</e> made better points that relate to my future in this<a> country</a> 
<e>Obama</e>: "I'm the president and I'm always responsible." Is that why you spent the past four years blaming Bush? #HofstraDebate #<e>Romney</e>2012 
<e>Obama</e> <a>finished</a> strong 
<e>Obama</e> for the win!!! #<a>debate</a> 
Don't blame that on <e>Obama</e> , he's trying to create <a>more jobs</a> but you can't do that in four years 
@TheDaleJackson I think <e>Obama</e> <a>won</a> slighly, but not for substance. He delivered his rhetoric & lies very well. 
I don't look at my <a>pension</a>; it's not as big as yours #Debate #<e>Obama</e> 
<e>Obama</e>..More<a> poised, fluid</a>, <a>natural</a>. Achieved what he needed to. Good work.

Eghh. As an objective viewer, gotta give the edge to <e>Obama</e>. No way this was a draw. 
<e>Obama</e> got too much <a>confidence</a> Mitten 
<e>Obama</e> should look in the camera and say : look me in my face "I ain't got no worries! " ! 
Words for words...points by points...President <e>Obama</e> explained, corrected or just shuttled the door on.... BRAVO, MR. PRESIDENT!... 
I'm tired of everybody talking bout the first <a>debate</a> <e>Obama</e> did what was suppose to be done he studied his opponent  #BeatIt 
Why would you ask <e>Obama</e>s campaign manager about her opinion? Shes obviously gonna defend <e>Obama</e> 
â€œ@AnnCoulter: will love to see O in the unemployment line. <e>Obama</e> clinging to his job and paycheck.â€ 
I don't see the need to bash either of the candidates If you don't like <e>Obama</e> don't vote for him easy as that No need for all the negativity 
my vote is for Barack <e>Obama</e> 
<e>Obama</e> was more agressive this time tho.... I give him that. 
@CarolineManzo me either but people are calling for <e>Obama</e> as the winner... 
@KalebDaniel305 <e>Obama</e> can keep <a>talking</a> and you can KEEP listening but all I hear is rhetoric. 
@centsiblelife <e>Obama</e>, hands down

C'mon, @arifleischer. We both know #<e>Obama</e> didn't talk ab his plans because HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY. #debate #cnn 
@mehdirhasan he probably believes that <e>Obama</e> doesn't believe in the same god as he does or that <e>Obama</e> is a Muslim. 
@xoxo_MonaeLove Again he helped FIX that<a> economy</a> after <e>Obama</e> let the entire Nations economy crash and led to all state economies crashing

@KatieeB_ people who think <e>Obama</e>'s <a>health care ideas </a>are a good thing need a nice slap across the back of the head........... With a shovel.

â€œ@TheDemocrats: We're proud to be #TeamBarackâ€”RT if you are too.â€ #<e>Obama</e> 
So <e>Obama</e> in the last <a>debate</a> got it handed to him:-)  he actually tried this time and I'd still give the edge to <e>Romney</e> #gomitt 
Watched the <a>debate</a>, obviously. I find <e>Obama</e>'s energy policy laughable when earlier he said he planned to increase energy prices. 
RT: ABC and Fox Fact Check <e>Obama</e>:  Oil & Gas Drilling Permits ARE Down 60% Under <e>Obama</e>. #debates #utpol

The <a>moment</a> <e>Obama</e> won! http://t.co/Z3U9cGob 
Why do people think things are gonna get better if <e>Obama</e> is re-elected? It will be the exact same as the last 4 years. I don't understand. 
<e>Obama</e> or <a>civil war</a> 
Read the transcript. RNC chair accuses <e>Obama</e> of lying about Libya and moderator "aided and abetted." 
So why does <e>Obama</e> get props for bin laden, but doesn't get held responsible for <a>unemployment</a>, he inherited both, be fair I'm that 
That was fun!! I wish I had some snacks tho. Vodka flowing and fearing for the morning. <e>Obama</e> is back, Spain is in the clear, Greece is TOST 
As I predicted <a>Democrats</a> would say <e>Obama</e> won overwhelmingly. I am shocked Democrats would say their candidate won. 
#<e>Obama</e> wants to reinstate <a>"assault weapons"</a> ban. I'm glad that's on the record. #guncontrol 
@JustCeeC: President <e>Obama</e> should have dropped the mic and wall off stage after that last answer! I'd drop the mic for him. Lol 
#PDSLive republicans control the Oil. They raise the prices to make it look like <e>Obama</e> is doing badly. Even though we have surpluses 
@RyanSeacrest President <e>Obama</e>. 
<e>Obama</e> did good tonight 
<e>Romney</e> just got roasted. Deny it all you want ,<a>republicans</a>, but a monkey could judge that <e>Obama</e> won #debate2012 
@neaboo89 the problems <e>Obama</e> didn't create 
<e>Obama</e> has appeared weak and tired in several recent public forums. I wonder if he actually even wants to be president anymore... 
<e>Obama</e> <a>talked</a> louder, but didn't tell us what he would differently than he is already doing. Talked a lot,but said nothing. An empty suit. 
It's funny how these retired senators that are republicans are<a> endorsing</a> <e>Obama</e> 
I only wish <e>Obama</e> would have shown this vigor during the last <a>debate</a>! #Debate2012 
<e>Obama</e> keeps my hope alive in good men. 
Binder-women & "My pension is not as large as yours" will be the 2 memorable quotes from tonight's #<a>debate</a>. It's a draw edging toward <e>Obama</e>.

<e>Obama</e> 2012, President <e>Obama</e> WON the <a>debate</a>, vote early where your state allows and on November 6, 2012 
We  we confess that humility clothes President <e>Obama</e> and goodness and mercy are following him. Psalm 23 
Political beliefs aside, <e>Obama</e> belatedly lied about Libya. There is no denying it. The man has ZERO character. 
#foxnews krauthhammer says <e>Obama</e> won!

President <e>Obama</e> on equal pay: "This is not just a women's issue, this is a family issueâ€”this is a middle-class issue.

@iRoqueKurls my coworker are going in on president <e>Obama</e>... I wish I could show you what some if them are thinking... 
MSM is basically saying that <e>Obama</e> won this one because he wasn't as lousy as he was last time. 
Remember when <e>Obama</e> said 4 years ago that he was gonna cut <a>national debt</a> in half? That's funny because its almost doubled #idiot 
80% say <e>Obama</e> won #kewl 
@ZachMarin34 <e>Obama</e> definitely learned from the first <a>debate</a>! 
I could get to watch about half of the <a>debate</a>...What I felt Mr. President, <e>Obama</e>'s sincerity...I support <e>Obama</e>.  He is a good man! 
Man I hope <e>Obama</e> win though.. 
People need to understand the <a>US Government's</a> process before they bash <e>Obama</e>. Things that haven't been achieved are not from lack of effort 
<e>Obama</e> was terrific, now for the win... 
@moonyzhang aren't you sided with <e>Obama</e> too ? 
@edshow President <e>Obama</e> won. Willard kept going back to talking points & lies. Bet the righties didn't mind his interrupting.

@tiffanyshlain #Debates "Float like a butterfly,sting like a bee" #<e>Obama</e> 's<a> 47 point knockout </a>in the last round was just like #MuhammadAli .

Didn't even watch the <a>debate</a> because I can't stand listening to <e>Obama</e> make excuses for the hundreds of thousands of lazy Americans we have. 
@1rutwilldo yeah. <e>Obama</e>'s response to initial question was weak. The follow up question got a little weird. 
<e>Obama</e> hit a grand slam tonight, look for a 3-4 point bounce! Congrats Mr President 
<e>Obama</e> got a good point 
My Pop was 2 stepping, yelling "<e>Obama</e>' earlier around the house! Now he's really excited to vote, like it's his first time! Lol

 If you've lived in America the last four years and you still vote for <e>Obama</e>, you need to reevaluate your life. 
 @parmarash @realDonaldTrump @MittRomney Caught in lies?  You're looking at <e>Obama</e> the master liar who <a>overtaxes and forces co's to outsource</a> 
 He doesn't <a>care about our education</a>, he doesn't <a>care about our health</a>. <e>Obama</e> CARES. #VOTEOBAMA 
 <e>Obama</e> in top form on top of his game! Clear winner of <a>#debates2012</a> and hopefully the <a>election</a> 
 <e>Obama</e> reiterates that middle class drives the economy. #debates 
 @Talkmaster <e>Obama's</e> says everyone should play by the same rules ok everyone should have the same <a>tax rate</a> then... Only fair 
 great last <a>speech</a> <e>Obama</e> #Debate2012 #Obama2012 
 Well that was a pile of hog poop.  <e>Obama</e> is typical rude lib. 
 I hope I can catch a replay from the debates. Sounds like it was great for <e>Obama</e>. 
 So...the theory that <e>Obama</e> threw the first debate to make his effort in the second one seem more impressive is certainly looking viable.. 
 @ByronYork Truth is <e>Obama</e> pushed the movie explanation and did not <a>give America the truth</a> and he did not <a>give  the ambassador requested help</a> 
 the rhetoric of <e>Obama</e> tonight when talking about Libya and in gerneral. #onpoint #soempowering

 <e>Obama</e> definitely dropped the mic several times during this debate. He came to win and that's exactly what he accomplished tonight. 
 Better job <a>helping the middle class</a> <e>#Obama</e> 
 @Vinny_Sardo this supports the fact that you voted for <e>Obama</e> #dontrenig 
 I'm voting for <e>Obama</e> cuz hes <a>black</a>.

 Looks like <e>Obama</e> named winner by <a>CBS, Google and PPP snap polls</a>. No word from CNN poll yet. #presdeb 
<e>Obama</e> truly does represent all.  Barack Obama <a>pushes for equality</a>.  Who would not vote for that!?!? 
 The reason <e>Obama</e> got elected in the first place is his <a>smooth speeches filled with simple vocabulary</a>. 
 #TeamBarack <e>Obama</e>'s back!!! ... Fired Up, Ready to Go

 Favorite part of debate was when <e>Obama</e> tried to <a>answer the automatic weapons question</a> with his educational reform policy. #MakesSense #Not 
 @koojababy not trying to be mean but Fox is a very very biased station which is very republican, they HATE <e>Obama</e>. 
 If you can't see how <e>Obama</e> is screwing us over you need to open your eyes. I'm seriously worried about this country's future..

 @kristalsanford <e>Obama</e> didnt get elected without a majority of white people voting for him.It would be impossible to win through the minority 
 <e>Obama</e> saved the <a>auto industry</a> which has since added 100,000 jobs. 
 @David_Gergen I thought it was clear <a>Obama</a> win, but I always respect your analysis. Keen and well balanced. 
 Anyone else find it interesting <e>Obama</e> wore a red tie and <e>Romney</e> wore a blue tie tonight? They represent the other parties color. #Debates 
 "@5hannnnnon: <e>Obama</e> shut up you nigger. You're a <a>liar</a>. Your brother lives in Kenya where you were born. #Romney2012" Damn nt cool 
 <e>Obama</e> <a>speaks</a> with forked tongue #debate 
 Do people not realize that <e>Romney</e> is not a Christian? He believes in God, yes. But so does <e>Obama</e>. 
 @CaptKrunch <e>Obama</e>'s <a>campaign</a> is toast. Lying for a liar, nice. 
 All jokes aside- <e>Obama</e> was solid. Handled himself well 
 According to #cnn, <e>#Obama</e> wins this debate by 7 points

 @IngrahamAngle Americans died, and <e>Obama</e> <a>lied</a>.

 @gretawire Oh, P Buchanan where was <e>Obama</e> right? or doing well? the man was bitter sour ignorant arrogant & a very small <a>performance</a> 
 Basically <e>Obama</e> is the man 
 <e>Obama</e> did a much better job this time than in last <a>debate</a>. He was engaged this time. It wasn't enough #debates 
 <e>Obama</e> did very well, but the msnbc folks are I think vastly overestimating the impact on the race. 
 @russllj <e>Obama</e> was really good this evening. I was smiling! 
 @megynkelly I was uncomfortable with <e>Obama's</e> <a>stand -up & interrupt routine</a>. It was a well-practiced rudeness that failed as strength. 
 <e>Obama</e> constantly lies to the American people. He avoids <a>answering questions</a>. The choice is clear, #RomneyRyan2012 @gretawire 
 @GinoGraul @2homeboys <e>Obama</e> creates no <a>jobs</a>.He's had almost 4yrs to do something & he hasn't.And the 1st 2 yrs he had a democrat congress! 
 The debate was real, <e>Obama</a> was pretty <a>feisty</a>. 
 I didn't like <e>Obama</e>, but then I watched the presidential debate... and I still don't like Obama. 
 Oh yes he can!!  Barack <e>Obama</e> that's my president!! 
 <e>Obama</e> is <a>aggressive and poised</a> he's not taking Romney's shit this time. 
 @CNN <a>For the mess that Bush left us</a>, we couldn't have got a more hardworking POTUS than <e>Obama</e>. We are proud of him! 
 <e>Obama</e> was the bad boyfriend who stayed out all night,<a>made promises he never kept</a>. Don't run back to him-it's time to MOVE ON. #tcot #debate 
 If <e>Obama</e> wins the election I'm officially moving to Canada for the next four years. #GodHelpUs #RomneyandRyan 
 @Thomlane @LessaT In the 1st debate, it seemed <e>Obama</e> was aloof and disconnected. In this one, <a>angry</a>. Probably more un-Presidential n this 1. 
 @TheWorldOfAphil we've all seen from the talks of <e>Obama's birth certificate</e> that even birthdays can be <a>controversial</a>. 
 Wish I was at the debate. I woulda asked <e>Obama</e> how he allowed China, Coke, and Pepsi to drive up the <a>price of protein</a> by 35%. Dead serious 
 Mitt Romney did an awesome job in the debate tonight. Took President <e>Obama</e> to task, we can't afford another four years of this mess. 
 @thebighoot @comfypaws "combat forces" not trainers/other designated forces, exactly where Biden?<e>Obama</e> failed to keep our victories,<a>win Iran</a>

 @_Anthonypadilla and <e>Obama</e> lost the debate 
 The debate was interesting but I am Team <e>Obama</e> all the was 
 Finished watching the entire debate. <e>Obama</e> won hands down. 
 @WheresMyLiberty that doesn't even make sense. I'm not supporting <e>Obama</e>. I'm supporting someone who actually has a shot at beating him. 
 I don't even have commentary for this debate because President <e>Obama</e> <a>executed and dominated</a> 
 I'm gonna laugh when <e>Obama</e> wins and the country will be in the worst state ever and I'm gonna just laugh in your retarded faces.

 I wonder what would happen if we put <e>Romney and Obama</e> were one person. Boom! My friends would get along. This is why I stay out of politics. 
 President <e>Obama</e> does not even know the <a>laws of the land</a>...what a fucking idiot....read the Arizona Law, Mr. Lawyer before you talk about it 
 Why the heck was Romney even involved in #debate ?We need not forget that <e>Obama</e> has been there for 4 years and he has removed one Bin Laden 
 Wow - so <e>Obama</e> WAS wrong over <a>Benghazi</a> ... 
 Just remembered <e>Obama</e> is on @TheDailyShow tomorrow night! Confetti and balloons! Woot!! 
 <e>Obama</e> totally won the debate today. No doubt. 
 @peggychinn  I like that too, go <e>Obama</e> :) 
 @politicsmonkey I maintain that <e>Obama</e> will win. It will be close, but comfortable enough due to the electoral college… 
 You know I'm almost glad I missed the <a>debate</a> tonight.  Can't stand the garbage that comes from <e>Obama</e>'s mouth.  Makes me sick. 
 Horrified at how badly <e>Obama</e> seems to be doing in the <a>debates</a> 
 <e>Obama</e> lost debate.

 #Obama #Romney  Lies spoken in an articulate manner are still lies. This is a <e>Obama's</e> way.  He stood on the debate stage and lied..Fire him 
 @Talkmaster If Romney had to describe how different he is from W, shouldn't <e>Obama</e> '12 have to show how he's different from the last 4 yrs?

 Both <e>Romney and Obama</e> have really annoying speaking voices  
 The worlds gonna be one fucked up place if <e>Obama</e> takes presidency again #realtalk 
 Based on what I heard <e>Obama</e> say last night, if he gets re-elected, I am tempted to give up-close my business and unemploy 230+ folks! 
 @realDonaldTrump <e>Obama</e> was more of a boistrous bull spouting out the same old things that he DIDN'T achieve in 4 years and can't in 4 more. 
 @PaulRyanVP Ask America why the press has never ask <e>Obama</e> the tough questions these last 4 years. 
 @MeKaymi_Tensei He carried himself poorly in that <a>debate</a>, but I do think the shitty moderator gave <e>Obama</e> an advantage he didn't need. 
 @uhlyssaoliviero - if <e>Obama</e> gets elected, guys like me will go out of business. People who pay the taxes that enable fin aid, will be gone

 <e>Obama</e> has connections with Al queda terrorist organization.

 @wrocorn CNN proves again they are in the tank for a man who consistently lies to America.  CNN is not news, it's propaganda! <e>Obama</e> LIES! 
 Here bit by bit the American people are standing up to Socialisim,Communisim,Marxist Muslims and <e>Obama</e> the Black Master of Black the people. 
 Oh yeah. I love getting yelled about <e>Obama</e> at 9 in the morning #grandmaprobs 
 If you read today's news headlines, you'd think <e>Obama and Romney</e> were in a UFC cage match instead of using mildly heated rhetoric. 
 @TheTimmyTebow  Try to find something good to say about somebody if u can but lv <e>Obama</e> alone. It's not flattering to u. 
 I don't appreciate how <e>Obama</e> <a>capitalisizes</a> on the fact that he's black. 
 @BillPhill12 Omg, that was the funniest thing ever - and every person struggling in <e>Obama's</e> <a>economy</a> wanted to say it, too. 
 AllI can say about last night's debate is that <e>Obama</e> looked pretty desperate. 
 <e>Obama</e> called <e>Romney</e> an Azzhole!  #Funny 
 The amount of <e>Obama</e> <a>impressions</a> I hear is sickening. 
 But honestly, My opinion is neutral this year, and that's why I'm not even voting. Both <e>Mitt and Obama</e> are f'n shit up. Why bother... #meh 
 Shit that was a low blow to <e>Obama</e> omg lol 
 @bogealoge I don't have to I know what <e>Obama</e> <a>promised</a> hasn't come true

 <e>Obama administration</e> can't get even the simple aid to <a>Syrian rebels right</a>.  It is going to the Assad govt. 
 <e>#Obama</e> 2012-2016 
 I don't "hate" anyone... But I SERIOUSLY dislike <e>Obama</e>. The man irritates the hell out of me. <e>Romney</e> isn't much better. Reset button plz?! �� 
 @TheValorieClark i don't like either one. I am more socially conservative. But <e>Obama</e> hasn't done enough good in his <a>first four years</a>. 
 I'm going to put an <e>#Obama & #Romney</e> sticker on my car to confuse people. The good news is that I don't particularly like either of them... 
 @MichelleObama  awesome we really need <e>Mr. Obama</e> to win! 
 It's amazing looking at my twitter and Facebook feeds and seeing how republican my friends are. I was a miracle <e>Obama</e> even got in office. 
 Someone had a sticker on they car that said defeat <e>Obama</e>. Everybody should get out they car to whoop they ass 
 @DatBiebsGrande your not even worth fighting for so goodbye have a  sucking <e>Obama</e> shit day(: 
 <e>Obama</e> gone win again 
 President <e>Obama</e> doesn't even answer a ligit <a>question about the Libya situation</a> ...or didn't want 2. Families of the deceased want answers. 
 I really don't like bringing politics on social networks but despite my confusion I think I might go with <e>Obama</e> ... 
 .@SpoonerSpot Exactly. <e>Obama & Romney</e> are too well-rehearsed with stats that make voters' eyes glaze over. #debate 
 @seanhannity Did you notice <e>Obama's</e> demeanor and voice when Romney smacked him about Libya, he was pissed. 
<e>Obama</e> nailed it! #ObamaAtOU #fourmoreyears 
 <e>Obama</e> made the case for his 2nd term.  He showed the country his values and beliefs. 
 @UnPoliticalPrty I had to block that guy, if I wanted to hear to lies I'd listen to <e>Obama</e>. 
 Majority of undecided Xbox Live voters declare <e>Obama</e> victor of town hall debate:  Of the 2,000 or so undecided v...  
 <e>Obama</e> stated that we shall no more see warfare weapons on our streets. So please at least wrap them in a paper bag. #spinoza 
 <e>#Obama</e> probably gives out those little boxes of raisins on Halloween. 
 I tried to find a binder of women for $20 or less on Ebay. After coming up short, I decided to donate the $20 to <e>Obama's</e> campaign instead... 
 Who better to deceive the people than they own kind ... I really think <e>Obama</e> a puppet 
 We caught <e>#Romney</e> leaving church, caught <e>#Obama</e> a bar and drinking beer.. God gets you further then beer does! #TeamRomney 
 @dcwomenkicknass I never claimed to be a Romney supporter. I just don't support <e>Obama</e>. 
 @IngrahamAngle u were great on @OreillyFactor,,<e>Obama</e> wasn't good, he just set the bar really low the last time #Debates 
 <e>Obama</e> is averaging 5.7 lies per minute of talking during this #debate

 Man oh man I hope <e>Obama</e> wins. We're so screwed if not. 
 <e>Obama</e> did a great job 
 <e>Obama</e> won the debate 
 @ewilliam_ <e>Obama</e> record on what he promised and failed to do hurts him 
 One thing is clear…<e>Obama</e> legitimately does not like <e>Romney</e> as a person. He finds Mitt's success contemptible. #debates 
 @KimPinkx3 <e>Obama</e> is a huge supporter of community college 
 Idgaf if <e>Obama</e> is black, that's NOT a reason why we are voting for him! He's just amazing all around 
 Clearly <e>Obama</e> won! #debate2012 #obama #democrats #leggo 
 president <e>Obama</e> is the first president to get teenagers and young adults involved in watching the debate and want to vote 
 <e>Obama</e> has a lot of support. 
 @Lil3jmg My parents think <e>Obama</e> is the worst thing to ever happy to the United States. So glad I don't share the views as they do. 
 Proud to be a registered voter right about now, damn right I am voting for <e>Obama</e> again.......who mad? 
 @greggutfeld <e>Obama</e> had four more minutes of LIES!!! #debate 
 BREAKING: Shortly after the debate, <e>Obama and Moderator Candy</e> Crowley seen giving each other a high-five... #tcot #p2 #debate 
 I honestly don't want <e>Obama or Romney</e> to win. 
 Don't expect me to defend <e>Obama's</e> policies & broken promises. Like I said, blind political allegiance is funny. "@a_tweet_life @Al_Gorelioni 
 I think <e>Obama</e> is secretly a terrorist. His <a>name</a> scares me. "Barack Obama" come on son'! 
 Y'all see this shit --->"@5hannnnnon: <e>Obama</e> shut up you nigger. You're a liar. Your brother lives in Kenya where you were born. #Romney2012" 
 @Dakota_bruhh in all honesty, what has changed in your life to make you mad at <e>Obama</e>? 
 I say we have a hunger games politics style <e>Obama</e> vs <e>Romney</e> an throw Ron Paul and Herman Caine in there for kicks 
 Everyone Is Entitled To Their Own Opinions.. But I'm Proud To Say That I'm Voting For <e>Obama</e>. #thatisall 
 I've seen 3 Presidents look at and lie to the American people. Nixon, Clinton, now <e>Obama</e>. Obama's lie involved the death of four people. 
 This quote is for everyone who voted for <e>Obama</e> in 2008. "Fool me once shame on you. Fool me twice shame on me." #Romney2012 
 President <e>Obama</e> lied to the American population tonight. Dug a whole new hole for him on this Lybia thing. #Debates 
 Ed Gillespie: "For every <a>job</a> <e>Obama</e> admin created, 6 people left the workforce".  #debates 
 "99% of <e>Obama's</e> policies didn't work. Just like the people that voted for him." 
 <e>Obama</e>-Thanks for <a>answering questions in the first minute of your turn</a> instead of walking around them..... #abcpolitics 
 <e>Obama</e> shut up your a liar. <e>Romney</e> shut up your a liar. 
 Polls say <e>Obama</e> 46% vs <e>Romney</e> 39%. #debates 
 Even in 2008, <e>Obama</e> didnt statistically show he was a good enough candidate for Dew. 
 @aegies @BarackObama If i had the money and wasn't so broke because of college, i'd top that with $200. <e>Obama's</e> got my full support and vote 
 @itsKirenbitch <e>Obama</e> is classy as fuck. I wish I was American so I could vote for him. 
 I love how <e>Obama</e> <a>brought in the hiring of teachers into the AK47 question</a>. WTF? For the record hiring more gov doesn't grow the economy. 
 THIS WILL GET YO ASS BEAT"@5hannnnnon: <e>Obama</e> shut up you nigger. You're a liar.Your brother lives in Kenya where you were born. #Romney2012" 
 @DavidLimbaugh <e>Obama</e> not as compelling a liar as Clinton was. Not to mention media monopoly is not the same. 
 @akinfolaju how do u do... Didn't watch it but using wat I have read so far it was a good nite for <e>Obama</e> 
 "I know people that have <a>healthcare</a> because of <e>Obama</e>." ... "I know people that have <a>jobs</a> because of Obama." (via @jferg & @benjaminkelley) 
 <e>Obama</e> totally ignored nor really <a>nswered questions on Benghazi or "Fast & Furious"</a>!  And MSM says he "won"? LOL 
 <e>Obama</e> wins the 2nd debate! (Once the conservative commentators go for the moderator you know their candidate lost) 
 <e>#Obama</e> is the truth. 
 @AlexisClewis24 and like I said I dot care who president is.. But <e>Obama</e> sure as hell didnt do a good job fixing ANYTHING 
 @AshleyOkinawa lld I didn't say anything to harm their party, <e>Romney</e> did that for himself.I just commented on <e>Obama</e>! 
 @gaylortangg and <e>Obama</e> has strikingly similar ideologies to Jimmy Carter and Karl Marx, both of whom know nothing of successful nations. 
 <e>Obama</e> did not answer the question on Libya. <e>Romney</e> missed the opportunity to demand an answer n the moderator didnt demand an answer either! 
 "@coledixon15: <e>Obama</e> is a self centered jackass that needs to take his foreign ass back to his Muslim countries." @llcoollittle & this guy 2 
 @RNCResearch Heck it wasn't the lies that are the problem, it was the lack of <a>ideas</a> from <e>Obama</e>, so another four years of the same. 
 The Republican goal is not to beat <e>Obama</e> down. It's to shake down and beat down the American people. Keep your heads up. Obama 2012. 
 If I have to listen to one more <e>Obama</e> <a>speech</a>, I think I will end up in a loony bin. What a grating voice. 
 If <e>Obama</e> wasn't running for president would you still be excited about politics? 
 From assault rifles to education, <e>Obama</e> you are OWNING this <a>debate</a>. Brilliant public speaker, just fucking brilliant. 
 I am so pumped up right now. I cannot even sleep. #TeamObama - tonight we saw why we are going to do everything we can to reelect <e>#Obama</e> 
 Bringing manufacturing back question: <e>Romney</e> - China is a cheat and a thief. #yellowperilObama - invest in advance manufacturing, R&D, tech 
 Will <e>@BarackObama</e> EVER correct <e>Romney</e>? The vast majority of that deficit is Bush's--particularly his 2 wars Obama finally put on the books! 
 Listen <e>Obama</e>, Wallstreet and the big car companies you bailed out are in the same league. Quit blaming other people for your problems. 
 Finally just watched the debate on DVR.  Heated and what I have been waiting for, <e>Obama</e> was on the defensive for most of it. 
 I will admit, #Bush's spending was out of control. But <e>Obama's</e> <a>spending habits</a>... just completely unacceptable #NotFittoGovern #Debate2012 
 <e>Obama</e> you got Morgan Freeman to be spokesman on one of your commercials? Well since you got God to speak highly of you, you will win. 
 <e>Obama</e> did <a>lower taxes</a> on middle class. No Job, No Money, Lower Taxes #lnyhbt 
 @lindaph1 Hell <e>Obama</e> can't even take care of one border patrol agent how can he handle <e>diplomatic security</e>? BHO Admin. is a chinese cluster. 
 <e>Barack Obama</e> wins the debate. Bristol Palin voted off Dancing With The Stars. It's a great night to be a liberal in America! 
 Election news, CNN calls it for <e>Obama</e>. FOX News calls it for <e>Romney</e>. Adult Swim calls it a clear victory for Meatwad. 
 Today's Presidential Debate ws OK. For me, <e>#Obama</e> is a winner today by an Inch, jst 1 inch. He shud b more Charged up in d nxt &last rd. 
 <e>Obama</e> whooped both Romney and the moderator! Dayummmm #Obama2012 
 Taliban shot #Malala for her ideal was #Obama, All female fans of Brad Pitt, Justin Bieber etc should be careful in Pakistan 
 Wondering how <e>polls</e> can say Obama won the debate but <e>Romney</e> won on issues.  It's hard to understand polling at times! #perception #debate 
 <e>Obama's</e> <a>voice</a> is so assuring. 
 Heard <e>Obama</e> used Biden's acting coach - who evidently specializes in LYING & goofy looking fake aggression with angry eyes! 
 @KevinMcGil Whoooooooooaaa, Nellie! :-) RT FOX News poll has <e>Obama</e> winning tonight's #debate by 70%. @barackobama @davidaxelrod @joenbc 
 Oi why are Americans so ignorant? I think <e>Obama</e> is better than any other past president 
 Only watched enough of the debate to form an intitial impression, basically <e>Obama</e> <a>walked</a> in like a pimp and ate that face. 
 Wait for the foreign policy debate.@stretch4444 I wish <e>Romney</e> had brought up the multitude of daily briefings missed by <e>Obama</e> ! 
 Michelle <e>#Obama</e> broke debate rules by cheering when moderator lied about #Libya to save Barack's butt. #MSMBias 
 @ItsEmaxSnitches Who will win, <e>Obama or Romney</e>? click @VotetoWin_2012 and follow the link in her description! 
 The <e>#Obama</e> legacy:  Bad Policies = Poor Results = Gloomy Future. Would you really rehire him to make sure this happens?#Romney 
 Students have been camping out all night to see <e>Obama</e> and more students are beginning to line up! 
 I'm not racist but <e>Obama</e> needs to remember that a white man built this land. A black man sold his families to the white man. 
 @AidanLicks but if you want government to have less power, <e>Obama</e> should be your biggest enemy 
 <e>Mr. President</e> please stop the cover up. You did not call it a terrorist attack until 2 weeks after the attack. We have the transcript @Obama 
 @GMA who wrote this? Badly worded question. <e>Obama</e> won. 
 Interesting, too, that President <e>Obama</e> called Mitty on his "Social Ideas"-- BECAUSE  SOCIAL = PEOPLE and NOT CORPORATIONS ! 
 <e>Obama</e> calls out on Romney about his investment on companies (Bain Capital) outsourcing American jobs to China (Sensata plant in Illinois)... 
 #debate Rose garden presidential statement (3:53 mark) <e>Obama</e> says "All Americans always.." clearly not talking specifically of <a>Benghazi</a> 
 @keder False statemen. Obama had 14, Mitt Romney had 2, Crowley had 1. <e>Obama</e> wins on falsehoods #debate2012 
 @jay33231 just listening to <e>Obama</e> <a>talk</a> and blatantly <a>lie</a> is enough to make me want to vomit over and over again 
 White folks treasure being considered an honorary member of an oppressed people. A Republican coworker voted <e>Obama</e> to keep his hood card. 
 Best thing about the debate? If <e>Obama</e> thinks he won the first, he'll have a similarly distorted impression of the second. 
 Yes, <e>Barack Obama</e> LIED last night. On September 12 he was blaming a video, not terrorism, for Libya. LIED. #mapoli 
 EVERY American knows lots of people who are out of work since <e>Obama</e> was elected. THAT will get him fired! 
 If <e>Obama</e> wins this election because of women's issues...I lose faith in my gender. #prolife #smallgovernment #RomneyRyan12 
 Obama26Obama Let's hope WHEN <e>Obama</e> is overturned, he ends up on welfare and food stamps. ) 
 Why is the media is claiming a win for <e>Obama</e>? Actually being awake this debate doesn't count. I like him even less, he acted like a jerk. 
 <e>Obama</e> SHOULDN'T have to keep reassuring his base after last night. Please let him speak2&secure the independent& undecideds w/out criticism 
 #debate If <e>Obama</e> had been telling the truth last night, he might have won.  America loses when a President lies to our face! #RomneyRyan 
 For a man with 4 years on the job, pres <e>Obama</e> seems to be very uncertain and lacking of conviction. 
 Great debate for <e>Obama</e> last night I gotta say title of one of my newest song is what went down and that is (I Don't Run From Nobody) 
 @GayPatriot <e>Obama</e> is answering questions from US Weekly followers today. Let's overwhelm him with tough questions! 
 Final proof <e>Obama</e> won the debate, #FoxNews is "raising questions" about  Candy Crowley as moderator. #p2 #topprog #tcot 
 truth-<e>Obama</e> failed on emigration reform,but the republicans did to-they never gave any help even when they got what they wanted. 
 Why did <e>Romney</e> say unemployment rates have gone up since <e>Obama</e> took office? Wasn't there that study last week that said they'd gone down? 
 According to him, I'm what's wrong with society because I think comparing <e>Obama</e> to Hitler is disgusting and makes no sense. 
 <e>President Obama</e> is worth 12million and has money over in china 
 .@AndrewRugg Predictably, <e>the NYTimes and CNN</e> have declared <e>Obama</e> the winner and those are the MSM headlines. 
 <e>Obama</e> lied about <a>Libya and production of coal</a>.  Obama claimed he has signed more permits  for coal. Not true, People in WV are unemployed 
 @whoisdemichael actually, when <e>Obama</e> was a senator, he proposed the bills & approved the plans that are responsible for our nation's debt. 
 @Daggy1 <e>Obama</e> didn't. Went straight into education. High end jobs. Prob there is. High end = low volume. We got that now in Ireland. 
 @DETECTIVE4LIFE @davidwebbshow yes, <e>#Obama</e> had rage in him, felt bad for man in audience who asked question. Out of control n too defensive 
 Don't live in America so it doesn't concern me but I want to see <e>Obama</e> lose just to see what Romney can do in 4 years 
 @SydneyREDtaylor I don't think either of them are talking about taking away financial aid but I do think <e>Obama</e> has helped with that a lot. 
 They just said "Obama has really been pounding hard" on the news, do they even listen to themselves when they talk? haha 
 @Semkae I guess u didn't read the links I sent u. Even conservatives like Krauthammer and Laura Ingraham said <e>Obama</e> won @omarilyas @chiume 
 <e>Obama</e> is gonna outsource low paying jobs (most of y'all) Create more High skilled jobs. (NONE of y'all) 
 <e>Obama</e> hits back in fiery debate: A more aggressive Barack Obama buries the memory of a poor first showing as he and challenger Mitt R... 
 <e>Obama's #failingagenda</e> is burying the middle class and hurting families! RT if you agree and read more from AFP Prez @TimPhillipsAFP!! 
 <e>Obama</e> cannot run on his record and 4 more years would be a repeat of 1st 4 years @DishFeed 
 All of the Obama supporters keep asking for specifics of Romney's plan. I'm just asking for Obama to present any bit of a plan. 
 @brad4rdr  <e>Fox News</e> says Romney won. Given their record of accuracy, we can be confident that Obama did. 
 Yes <e>Obama</e> is DESTROYING the MYTH of White genetic & intellectual Superiority and? @jawbreakerctc01 @REM63489 @bootyisyou @BarackObama TKCAL 
 Well just found out <e>Obama</e> used to be a pot head #blowingupintheovaloffice 
 The only thing I understand about politics is that I hate <e>Obama</e> #nohope 
 FTD is irking the hell outta me. Buy flowers ONCE, and they parked their asses in my inbox like <e>Obama</e>. 
 "@WSJ: According to polls of undecided voters, <e>Barack Obama</e> narrowly won last night's presidential #debate." A narrow win is still a win! 
 <e>President Obama's</e> <a>little trips to Virginia</a> are really cramping my flight plans. 
 @TheSlimmyMan @evalongoria How did <e>Obama</e> win! Please explain. He didn't answer a single question he was asked? 
 @emilyctamkin You'll never see them post something like, "Well Hugo Chavez endorsed Obama, so LOOK AT WHAT <e>OBAMA'S</e> VOTING BASE REPRESENTS." 
 Ultimate irony!!! @Chris_Moody <e>Obama</e> to crowd in Iowa: "I certainly don't think politicians should control the health care that you get." 
 <e>Obama</e> is losing the election based on his last 4 years of lack luster performance. He has a history now. VOTE #mitt2012 lets get jobs moving 
 "I consider it a part of my responsibility as president of the United States to fight against negative stereotypes of Islam." - Barack Obama 
 Enslaves people to the government just like what <e>Obama</e> wants to do in this country 
 I will soon. Just sat down for the 2016 <e>Obama's</e> America movie. 
 Romney doesn't have a five point plan, he has a one point plan - <e>Obama</e> ...That's right call his bullshit!  
 @ChicGrl427 @RepubGrlProbs I don't think <e>Obama</e> won, but I see your point. 
 Biden on debate last night: <e>Obama</e> showed himself as "a man of principle, a man of  gumption, with a steady hand and a clear vision." 
 <e>Romney's</e> history of hiring women from his binders is noteworthy, <e>Obama's</e> history of hiring from welfare list not so much.  Your choice. 
 & Yessss <e>Obama</e> won last night debate :) 
 @americasvoice  are Latinos Libs fucking insane?It's <e>Obama</e> policies which have resulted in record deportations&S-Comm of millions Mexicanos! 
 Anyone see the irony on the left proclaiming this big debate victory when <e>Obama</e> lied to pretend he was practically a conservative? #teaparty 
 Everybody taking about i love Obama,i love Romney and I'm like,I LOVE WEED!! 
 I hope BravoTV hosts a Real Presidents Reunion series with Romney and Obama after the election #debate 
 <e>Obama</e> doing a wonderful job. 
 <a>"Governor Romney you don't have a 5 point plan, you have a 1 point plan"</a> <e>@BarackObama</e> that was a good one. #Debates 
 @JoeBiden <e>Obama</e> won the debate by a landslide 
 @KeithMcCullough @daytrend  IF <e>Obama</e> won, it was with the help of the moderator. I call that cheating. 
 @cavuto I'm a small business owner and think <e>Obama's</e> <a>policies</a> are great. P.s stop reporting alleged attack as end the world! 
 @zanzerjewel Who will win, Obama or Romney? click the link in the profile of @VotetoWin_2012 to vote now 
 @washingtonpost have you dummies still not realized, as CNN has already said, that mitt Romney did not misstep. <e>@BarackObama</e> lied again 
 I'm voting for <e>Obama</e>. Even thought he did not fulfill all othe promises due to tough making decions he still helped us in some serious ways. 
 <e>Obama</e> have Teenagers watching the "Presidential Debate " ! He's the first President to do that! That's what you call  making CHANGES ! 
 And <e>Obama</e> is the savior who is going to bring world peace to the world. 
 @hardball James #Lipton to Chris #Matthews:America has a choice--does she want a president or a boss...and I mean a boss. <e>#Obama #Romney</e> 
 @EvaLongoria @NathanFillion you got to be kidding... <e>Obama</e> lies-When his lips are moving.  Should be tried for treason, impeached and jailed

 My aunty said she votin fa Mitt Romney , caus <e>Obama</e> be smoking too much caus his lips blk... Lmmfao ! 
 I find it very interesting that <e>Obama</e> criticizes Romney for having a large pension. I guess he thinks success is bad. That's the Obama way. 
 When they were talking about immigration, <e>Romney</e> called them "illegal." <e>Obama</e> called them "undocumented." It's the little things. 
 Key difference between <e>Romney & President Obama</e> is Romney talks about WHAT he's going to do while Obama talks about HOW he's going to do it. 
 I guess everybody i follow is voting for <e>Obama</e>,  cus everybody bad mouthing Romney lol 
 Too many people on the Obama bandwagon solely because he's black. 
 @Trollpecki I thought this was Romney v Obama, not Romney v Candy and Barry 
 Whats the Difference...between <e>Obama</e> and a Monkey..?The Monkey has smaller ears.LOOOOOOOOOOL.Nah I kid. But forreal..tho Fuck Politics. 
 Hey <e>Obama</e>! you export <a>inflation</a> to the world you dick! #YouHaveNoBrain 
 <e>Obama</e> wants to lower corporate tax rate? News to me... #debate 
 I believe the <e>moderator</e> is slightly favoring Obama #ohwell #notmad #heisthepresident 
 <e>Obama</e> questions Romney's commitment to women's health care, pointing to the Republican's vow to eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood. 
 @Jadore_Elidja @santi_41 Mr.pena I think you should go for <e>Obama</e> now. (Not that I'm anyone to say but after that, just sayin) 
 If you or ya folks ain't rich, and you got loans, yo ass need to be tryna vote for <e>Obama</e> 2 or 3 times! lol #SallieMaeAintNoHoe lmaoo 
 Is it bad that one of the reasons that I like <e>Obama</e> (in a politically unbiased way) is that he wears nice <a>suits</a>? #shallow 
 <e>Romney</e> great answer on foreign competition, <e>Obama</e>-there you go again, give me 4 more years & I'll do better next time, trust me 
 <e>Obama</e> only makes sense 
 To make this debate more interesting Obama just needs to start rapping  #justsaying 
 @ilaffalot Nah I think <e>Romney's</e> gunna throw a punch at <e>Obama</e>. It's getting heated! 
 Seriously... <e>Obama</e> is not going to bring up the 47 percent remark? 
 Just heard my dad say "Obama shut up"  hahaha. How bout we say fuck both these old dudes. Vote for real freedom#SamRussellForPresident 
 @TrIzZySpaCedOuT and if you were actually interested I would ask you to tell me the bad things Obama has done as president. 
 I think the only people stupid enough to vote for <e>Obama</e> again are the ones who can vote for the first time this year #smfh #getout #NObama12 
 Romney is getting drowned out by both Obama and Crowley! #debate 
 Ahaha did that mediator lady really just back up Obama and shit on Romney?! At a girl! 
 I wish I could just hug <e>President Obama</e> and tell him every little thing will be okay. 
 <e>Obama</e> is good if he got the tennage community watching this debate 
 No doubt #Obama has gotten more time to talk. Yet if #Romney goes over by a few seconds, the President gripes to #Candy. #Debate 
 Some black people our age may or may not vote for Obama, but MOST older black people out of school, working, or retired will vote for him. 
 According to <e>Obama</e>, Schools(gun free zones) are the answer to F&F. What a putz.  #2012debate 
 I'm at work. What did <e>Obama</e> do that made everyone lose their shit? 
 The press room busted out laughing when <e>Obama<e> said <a>" my pension isnt as big as yours "</a> LOL , Good comeback dawg ! 
 @DivaStateOvMind I don't even care about all of this forreal....but <e>Obama</e> won this one! lol....Kilt that perfect hair Mitt! lol 
 Every American that I follow is obviously impressed that <e>Obama</e> is president.. -___- 
 <e>Obama</e> says he believes in self reliance? What a joke! He believes in a nanny state! 
 #PresDebate There! Obama said it. The 47 percent. His closer. 
 And Democrats finally breathe as Obama says "47 percent" 
 Notice how <e>Obama</e> didn't need to be told to stop. 
 Much better <e>Obama</e> 
 <e>Obama</e> wins, hands down! #current2012 
 I just want <e>Obama</e> to read a bedtime story to me. I love listening to him <a>speak</a>. 
 Oh, so now <e>Obama</e> cares about the <a>military</a>? That's funny, wasn't he just photographed saluting Marines while on the phone? Right. #BS 
 <e>Obama</e> is so cute! :') I love him. 
 <e>President Obama</e> Is Great Man && He Deserves More Respect Then Romney Is Giving Him ! 
<e>Obama</e> is now pandering! Since when does he believe in free enterprise? 
 Yay <e>President Obama</e> did it hands down!!!! Yeah buddy 
 <e>Obama</e> kicked ass in this debate in my opinion. #debates 
 Black people make up a bunch of bullshit excuses to cover up the fact that they voting for <e>Obama</e> kuz he black lol that sh** be too hilarious 
 I will never stop loving watching the First Couple.  No one can ever say that <e>Obama</e> doesn't love his wife! #debate 
 Ughhh <e>Obama's</e> <a>voice</a> makes me cringe #youareannoying #idonotlikeyou 
 @JenGranholm <e>Obama</e> cool as the ice in my freezer cnt wait until the War Room tomorrow!! 
 <e>Obama</e> killed it man. Good job on proving that factual error by your opponent. I'm proud.  
 "And that's how you debate biatch" - <e>President Obama</e> as he looks at Romney and drops the mic and leaves the stage. #DNC2012 #GOP2012 #tcot 
 <e>Obama's</e> most important job is CINC. He failed in his mission with <a>Benghazi</a>. He lost. He should be fired. Everything else is window dressing. 
 <e>Obama</e> must have gotten really high <a>oral</a> marks in english when he was in highschool. Probably roasted the fuck out of everyone. 
 Classic <e>all the moderators</e> thus far have all been die hard liberals pulling for Obama and Mitt still wrecks him. 
 Romney asking <e>Obama</e> if he has funds offshore, Obama's face was like bitch I barely got funds inshore lol 
 @Ed @stevenportnoy @ABCNewsRadio I cant believe my ears!! What is wrong with people? They are so pro <e>Obama</e> they are def and blind 
 Wow! Great job <e>Obama</e>.What a comeback. Lol#PresidentialDebate 
 Or <e>Obama or mit</e> or big big bird or the economy or food stamps or the pell grant or jobs or education NOTHING!!!

 Great debate performance by <e>President Obama</e>! Much improved from last time 
 <e>Obama</e> won that #debate hands down!!! Vote @barackobama!!! 
 @MonicaBrown FYI 47 percent are ecstatic about <e>President Obama's</e> performance tonight Mitt Romney. Our President is the truth! 
 @Foobian no matter who the fuck our president is and I think that if <e>Obama</e> stays in office that things will get better eventually... 
 Everyone seems so close minded, either <e>Obama</e> or no one and that's it and that makes you ignorant, we need to know both sides 
 <e>Obama</e> - Same rudeness and arrogance that has been part and parcel of this presidency. Vote the bum out. 
 Very impressed with <e>#Obama</e> tonight. Much more engaged and prepared. No doubt about my vote #ObamaBiden2012 
 @zachbraff @donald_faison I just realized if you 2 had <e>a baby</e>, he'd probably look like Obama in 50 years.

 <e>Obama</e> always linked <a>Benghazi</a> to Cairo in order to link it with the video. He clearly did not call it a planned act or terrorism.

I hope <e>Obama</e> <a>responds</a> with "i didn't say you didn't care about 100% of the ppl. You did." 
So if government doesn't create <a>job</a> #mittswordsThen how is it <e>Obama's</e> fault there is no job growth 
if we gave Bush 8 years to fuck our shit, we give <e>Obama</e> 8 years to <a>fix</a> it. #TeamObama 
Same God? <e>Obamacare?</e> Did <e>Romney</e> suddenly switch <e>sides?</e> <a>#debate</a>

It seem like <e>Obama</e> never really have time to <a>make</a> his <a>point</a> but Romney do ?? 
Y'all see how <e>Obama</e> actually explained to us what he PLANS to do for corporate tax rates. Romney still hasnt told us any of his <a>plans</a> yet... 
#nbcPolitics I looove how <e>Romney</e> is <a>trashing</a> Obama. #RomneyNation #Romney2012

Barack <e>Obama,</e> Shawn Carter, & Sean Combs have to be the <a>COOLEST</a> OLD' HEADS in the world! #TRUTH 
<e>Obama</e> just <a>lying</a> now. 
<e>Obama</e> can <a>come</a> to my house, I'll dye his hair and feed him tons of food. 
<e>Romney</e> is a genuinely <a>nice</a> guy. He has a great record in MASS. What does Obama have again? Oh, right. 
@ResCon1 Romney <a>said</a> <e>Obama</e> is responsible 4 the security failures that killed our pple in Libya,Obama said nothing.#theblaze2012 #debates 
@danielleverde lol <e>@BarackObama</e> <a><e>got</e></a> this in the bag! He was the president of debate at Harvard! This what he do! <e>Romney</e> is full of <e>lies!</e> 
@applejacks_hunt @joeymask1 Race has nothing to do with it I actually favored <e>Obama</e> against McCain..but everything he said was <a>lies..</a> 
<e>Obama</e> needs to shut up, he made our <a>economy</a> shit 
Aaaand <e>Romney</e> is still an <a>idiot.</a> #NoSpecifics #CantAnswerHow #Obama2012 
<e>Obama</e> believes in risk takers being rewarded - except when the <a>reward</a> exceeds government mandated levels. #debates 
My grandparents think <e>Obama</e> is the <a>antichrist</a> 
<e>Obama</e> believes in <a>Free</a> <a>Enterprise,</a> but "everybody should have a fair shot" 
@Crystal_Wright That's right! In fact there are 900,00 AA female entrepreneurs in the US now who <a>aren't</a> <a>dissatisfied</a> with President <e>Obama!</e> 
<e>Obama</e> is now saying he is a republican. He is right that there needs to be more free market an less gov <a>control.</a> That's what republicans do 
If <e>Obama</e> is re-elected, I'm going to purchase my first <a>gun.</a>  End of story.  #RomneyRyan2012

#winning <e>Obama</e> mentioned the <a>47%!!</a> Wooooo! #debate 
<a>47%</a> is finally brought up by <e>Obama.</e> #Boom 
<e>Obama</e> sort of walked into that one. Romney said that all Obama does is attack him. Obama stands up and <a>attacks</a> him. 
#debate "there are some <a>jobs</a> that won't come back". <e>Obama.</e> Get off your ass and make corp. <a>Taxes</a> competative, and stop blocking anwar. 
Once again <e>Obama</e> is not <a>answering</a> the question 
LOL. <e>Obama</e> saved the best for the last. <a>47%.</a> 
<a>47</a> PERCENT. <e>Obama</e> runs with it. At last. #PrezDebate2 
DAYUMMM <e>Obama</e> <a>hit</a> Romney with that K-O punch at the end 
<e>Obama</e> is going all <a>Biden</a> on Romney's ass. 
I may be slightly biased as I really don't like the republican way of life - but I think <e>Obama</e> <a>won</a> the debate on substance #debates 
<e>Obama</e> has done nothing for vets but <a>insult</a> them. 
FINALLY! I knew he was saving it for the last! <e>Obama</e> mentions the <a>47%.</a> #PMTdebate 
<e>#Obama's</e> literally putting me to <a>sleep</a> #townhalldebate 
Proud of <e>Obama</e> for <a>reminding</a> everyone of what Romney has said. #sorrynotsorry

But <e>Obama</e> gets final word on <a>47%</a> #fourmoreyears 
<e>Obama</e> <a>won</a> that ! 
The last 4 years didn't work out like <e>Obama</e> <a>promised,</a> it's time to move on and give Mitt Romney the chance to fix these mistakes #addebate2 
<e>Obama</e> <a>did</a> great! 
The only way I would vote for <e>Obama</e> is if he <a>banded</a> soccer from The United States . 
<e>Obama's</e> passionate last <a>answer</a> was worth watching this whole slugfest.  #OFA_VA #OFA #debate  Great job, Mr. President!

<e>Obama</e> 4 more <a>years!!!</a> 
<e>Obama</e> is just threw a verbal World Star Bus Driver Uppercut to end the <a>#debate</a>

<e>Obama:</e> "I believe in <a>self-reliance."</a> Mr. President, I'm sorry, but I rely on God. He wakes me up and I live for Him. #HowItWorks 
Way to close out <e>Obama.</e> Well <a>done.</a> 
I have no doubt in my mind that <e>Obama</e> <a>won</a> that debate 
I'm sorry but <e>Obama</e> <a>killed</a> it. #Debate2012 
<e>Obama</e> just went in for the kill with Romney's <a>47%</a> comments.#winning #debate 
Once again, <e>Obama</e> get 4 <a>more</a> <a>minutes</a> 
Romney brings up the same points over and over again and tries to make them relevant. <e>Obama</e> brings up relevant points to <a>answer</a> questions. 
OMG <e>Obama's</e> closing was insanely <a>great.</a> WWII grandpa and GI Bill? Slam dunk. #debate 
<e>Obama</e> <a>beasted</a> tonight.

Debate was really a verbal boxing match.. <e>Obama</e> <a>won</a> round 2! 
Solid <a>47%</a> reference <e>Obama.</e> That really was a scumbag thing to say 
Romney 40:50 and <e>Obama</e> 44:04. Wonder how many times Obama and Crowley <a>shouted</a> Mitt down. 
<e>Obama,</e> you better save that <a>47%</a> comment to close out your argument!!! 
<e>Obama</e> <a>wins!</a> 
<e>Obama</e> <a>killed</a> it

<a><e>Obama</e></a> 
Yessss <e>Obama</e> <a>won</a> this 
<e>Obama</e> <a>dropping</a> the mic would've have been hilarious! 
<e>Obama</e> best do really <a>well</a> on the next one. 
Fox going into meltdown, <e>Obama</e> must've <a>won</a> #debates 
Gon <a>head</a> President <e>Obama</e> lol :) 
I hate political analyists sometimes, because they be making <e>Obama</e> look <a>bad.</a> 
President <e>Obama</e> signing autographs with that left hand. Yum!  So <a>attractive!</a> 
<e>Obama</e> <a>Body</a> <a>Language</a> again  - looking for his teleprompter and just rambling on 
<e>Obama</e> <a>killed</a> it. #fourmoreyears 
Yo wife is ugly Romney , she don't have nothing on the <a>flawless</a> <e>Michelle</e> Obama 
@FoCrealdoe <e>Obama</e> <a>grew</a> up in Hawaii. 
<e>Obama</e> <a>won!!!</a> #thatisall 
@Moniggyy <e>People</e> just like Obama cause he's <a>black!</a> #Racists #TeamRomney 
#debates <e>Obama</e> <a>home</a> <a>run</a> 
Anytime <e>Obama</e> talks about <a>believing</a> in America and Americans, I just don't believe it. 
#autograpgh <e>Obama</e> <a>signing</a> autograpghs like he is some rock star... give me a break. 
@LatinosMatter: <e>#Obama</e> MOPS THE FLOOR with #Mitt Romney!!!! Yes he <a>did!</a> 
<e>Obama</e> brought the <a>grit</a> tonight. I'm proud. 
<e>Michelle</e> Obama is one tall <a>bitch!</a> 
Very well played by <e>Obama</e> to save the <a>47%</a> comments for last....great <a>performance</a> tonight, made me proud 
<e>Obama</e> <a>won</a> this! #handsdown 
What an intense, tension filled debate. Libya moment was deciding moment, <e>Obama</e> <a>wins</a> this one. Obama came to play tonight. #obama2012 
Bottom line, <e>Romney</e> <a>did</a> a great job tonight of reminding people of the failed Obama policies over the past 4 years. 
So <e>Obama</e> has a Morgan Freeman narrated <a>commercial.</a>  #itsover #hewins 
These <e>people</e> don't care, they just want <a>pictures</a> taken with Obama. 
<e>Obama</e> is <a>doing</a> the best he can for the mess of a country he got handed! #Obama2012 
<e>Romney</e> not even <a>letting</a> Obama talk 
@CadenHaynes because <e>Obama</e> is a <a>beast.</a> 
<e>Obama</e> <a>Wins</a> by a landslide! :) 
Exactly! RT"@CharlesMBlow: Obama saves "47%" for the last two minute so that <e>Romney</e> couldn't <a>respond.</a> #crafty #debate" 
<e>Obama</e> <a>won</a> this debate as soon at Romeny opened his mouth! 
Is it just me or did <e>Obama's</e> <a>hair</a> get whiter during the debate?...lol 
Of course Mr <e>Obama</e> waits to bring up <a>47%</a> at the end when @MittRomney can't explain! Wow worried #potus? 
If <e>Obama</e> don't <a>win</a> this debate.......real Nigga shit......I'm gonna burn to house down. 
What's funny is, I think Mr. <e>Romney</e> <a>did</a> better this debate. Raising your voice and saying Obamacare a lot in first debate was not a victory. 
I'm pretty sure any president that took over after Bush would've had the same <a>difficulties</a> as <e>Obama.</e> Give him another four tears to fix it 
<e>Obama</e> verbally <a>hit</a> him with that uppercut. 
It was <a>nice</a> of <e>Obama</e> to show up for the debate this time. 
@Slate <e>Obama</e> <a>won</a> Romney got blitzed. Though I am voting for Obama I thought Romney won the first. 
Ig I'm the only one who <a>doesn't</a> <a>like</a> <e>Obama.</e> 
Thanks for <a>showing</a> up this time <e>Obama,</e> it's nice to have you back. #Obama2012 #forward 
<e>Mitt</e> and <e>Obama</e> are gonna go home and continued this <a>debate</a> on Skype 
Although <e>romney</e> didnt do as bad as <e>obama</e> in the 1st debate, I see it as <a>1-1</a> Obama won this round, next is boca raton. 
#debates <e>Obama</e> really clear <a>winner</a> 
My dad annoys me with how much he thinks <e>Obama</e> is like satan and <a>evil.</a> #chill #hesnotplottingtodestroytheuniverse 
<e>@BarackObama</e> just <a>punch</a> Romney in the. diiicck! 
@GaymerCon So <e>Obama</e> could <a>sweep</a> <a>in</a> and save the day. 
Did anyone notice <e>Obama</e> and his wife <a>patting</a> each others back? Really? 
Oops my husband just said <e>Obama</e> <a>mopped</a> the <a>floor</a> with this one! 
& u look like a non muthaf*ckin factor RT @realDonaldTrump: <e>Obama</e> is looking rhetorical and <a>weak.</a> @MittRomney is looking strong and sharp 
<e>YObama</e> so ratchet, he was bouta <a>punch</a> dat Romney nigga in the throat least 8 times 
@WSJ <e>Obama</e> <a>won</a> and he won Big!!! 
@CNBC2012 <e>Obama</e> may have won the battle but will he win the war?  4 more years of Obama is 4 more years of <a>Failure.</a> 
@ZainMotani <e>Obama</e> can <a>free</a> Boosie with a pardon at the end of his presidency. #wipemedown 
Mitt stuck his chin out and <e>Obama</e> <a>punched</a> it -Chris Matthews 
I <a>hate</a> that the <e>reporters</e> reporting after the debate are getting on President Obama! 
<e>Obama</e> <a>took</a> out the elite four with a metapod and no pokedex, they wouldn't even let Romney through the front door. 
What if <e>Obama</e> and <e>Biden</e> were able to tag <a>team</a> during the debate... 
He stuck his chin out and <e>Obama</e> <a>punched</a> him hard. #Obama2012 #debate 
#the <e>debate</e> is <a>boring</a> to watch after a while. I get tired of hearing Obama go ummm, ughhhh, and well actually... #anoying 
Amazing that <e>Obama</e> would seek to dodge Benghazi and Romney would let him. In the end, Obama said the <a>buck</a> stops with him. True statement... 
is <e>Obama</e> trying to debate about guns? he doesn't know a thing about <a>guns</a> and that's #fact 
@BenjaminWavey that sounded racist against my own race hahaha but I meant I'm <a>team</a> <e>Obama.</e> And yes! 
@gretawire I felt bad for <e>Obama,</e> he lost 2 <a>debates</a> .His record  looks bad. 
HA RT @SwinCash: #Welp President <e>Obama</e> hit em with the <a>47</a> percent like the UpperCut heard around the world.. Then drops the mic... *Tears* 
@Larrys_Bitch seeing as I'm canadian& don't know as much about america as you do, all I have to say is my family would be <a>voting</a> for <e>Obama.</e> 
@IChogan @Yo_Floyd <e>Obama</e> had more sense, less God. Simple <a>fact.</a> 
That <a>debate</a> was like <e>Obama</e> being the bus driver & Romney being that rude bitch. 
@papchuseyo <e>Obama</e> <a>sucks...</a> 
@BrettMineer: <e>Obama</e> needs to end on <a>47%!</a> Just for fun! #hofdebate #Romney #Obama he did and very well too. 
Pres. <e>Obama</e> handled this <a>debate</a> much better than the first. 
Smart move by <e>Obama</e> waiting for the last word to directly address <a>47%.</a> 
(President) - Barack <e>Obama</e> <a>killed</a> it tonight, lets do our parts and keep him in office if you truly support him #Obama2012 
Mane I'm in the process of trying to get <a>rich...everybody</a> PLEASE vote for <e>Obama</e> #SelfishTweet lol 
<e>Obama</e> <a>won</a> that debate easily.  As a woman Romney was so offensive. 
Mamas dont let your babies <a>grow</a> up to be <e>Obama,</e> let em pick guitars and drive them ol trucks cause cowboys have manners they don't interrupt 
I don't think <e>Romney</e> was as terrible as Obama was in the first debate. But it sure felt like he got <a>whupped.</a> 
this. RT @_FrenisWorld_: Ok <e>Obama</e> clearly <a>won.</a> Now go to Fox and they'll say Romney won and the moderator was wrong for interrupting Romney. 
<e>Obama</e> clearly <a>won</a> that debate 
<e>Obama</e> again <a>speaks</a> about four minutes longer than Romney. 
<e>Obama</e> <a>shat</a> on Romney. 
@CNBC2012 Moderator <e>Candy</e> Crowley is <a>biased!!!</a> You dont interupt Romney so Obama can speak. She shouldnt be allowed to vote!!!! 
Yes, it's hard to change a country in 4 years. But <e>Obama</e> knew that when he promised he would do it... And he <a>didn't.</a> 
I would say <e>Obama</e> <a>killed</a> it in that one!Obama and Biden: 2Romney and Ryan: 1 
<e>Obama</e> <a>Won</a> This Debate . 
#hofdebate all the hard work and sacrifice of the Hofstra community and <e>Obama</e> didn't even have the <a>courtesy</a> of acknowledging where he was! 
<e>Obama</e> got the trap niggas, hood niggas, twerkers, hoes, dope boys, & weed smokers watching the <a>debate.</a> Name one president who has done that? 
Wow <e>Michelle</e> Obama was just in Chapel Hill, now she's at the <a>debate.</a> #SheFlyin 
@GMA @ThisWeekABC @GStephanopoulos - I hope y'all won't miss and/or dodge the fact that (a) <e>#Obama</e> <a>LIED</a> and (b) Candy ran interference. 
@johncerisola The only reason teenagers like <e>Obama</e> is cause he's <a>black</a> and everyone thinks he's cool and like you just said a thug. Like no. 
Stfu. RT @realDonaldTrump: Such long <a>rhetorical</a> and boring answers from <e>Obama.</e> No wonder nothing gets done. 
@Evan_Sofa so is <e>Obama</e> but you don't see him <a>bragging</a> about it 
<e>Obama</e> <a>won</a> !!!  Send Romny back home 
when Obama can't answer a question, he has the <e>moderator</e> <a>save</a> him by changing the subject. 
<e>Obama</e> <a>killed</a> itttt. 
#debates <e>Obama</e> <a>knows</a> what is needed for this country. Romney is just gonna screw things up by putting his foot in his mouth! 
<e>Obama</e> <a>delivered</a> a.bis driver uppercut. Boom!! #debate 
<e>Obama</e> exceeded expectations, a low bar set by the last debate, yet he still <a>loses.</a> He's shared no vision for what he'd do w/ 4 more years. 
Comparing <e>Obama</e> & Romney's <a>financial</a> aid policies - http://t.co/lS158tgk 
<e>I</e> <a>unfollowed</a> her ass for saying team Obama. #thatshitstopstoday 
Final minute <a>breakdown</a> for <e>debate:</e> Pres Obama at 43:57, Romney at 40:58 minutes. 
<e>Obama</e> is the definition of <a>#Clutch</a> 
You fail to realize that <e>Obama</e> is not from the hood. In the <a>hood,</a> your life will suck no matter who the president is. 
I think the moment when <e>Obama</e> really showed he was <a>serious</a> was when the Libya subject came up. He took over with fire in his eyes 
It's amazing how Romney criticizes <e>@BarackObama</e>  for what he didn't do but his <a>plans</a> will take 5-8 years to see real change. #NOT BACKWARDS! 
Good <a>win</a> <e>Obama!!</e> Well won!! #Easy 
<a>"Aggressiveness"</a> is not in <e>Obama's</e> character so it seemed misplaced #butthatsjustmethough 
@DYANCASTILLEJO <e>Obama,</e> I feel his <a>sincerity.</a> 
<e>Obama</e> better give that black guy a hamburger, so he will <a>vote</a> for him again 
<e>Obama</e> once again <a>murdered</a> Romney in the Debate Tonight !! #Obama2012 
Our viewing party room thinks <e>Obama</e> <a>won</a> this debate. How about you? 
Approx Time period: Obama had 43:57. <e>Romney</e> had 40:48. Romney with the <a>win!</a> 
Libya issue seemed to be one of the most significant parts of debate... Interesting how <e>Obama</e> <a>owned</a> up to incident after Hillary's comments 
<e>Ron</e> <e>Paul</e> could <a>blow</a> both Obama and Romney out of the water in this debate. #nobandwagoner 
I really just <a>don't</a> <a>like</a> <e>Obama</e> 
<e>Obama</e> was on point. Engaged and <a>strong.</a> Mitt seemed arrogant. 
Wether some want to admit it or not, some people just are going to vote for <e>Obama</e> just because he is <a>black.</a> SOME not all 
@DevinSullivan21 <e>Obama</e> gon <a>beat</a> yo ass ! 
<e>Obama</e> <a>won</a> that debate !! 
Rt ha truth"@HURTJR: When <e>Obama</e> speak.. I <a>listen</a> carefully, when Romney speak i check my twitter, Facebook, Instagram and scratch my ass" 
<e>Obama</e> <a>won</a> http://t.co/AqChYUTK via @MarketWatch 
@CallMeGrayy true, but the <a>policies</a> <e>Obama</e> has in place haven't worked and he plans to continue them 
@dannyajasso I don't know, the <a>Libya</a> question and getting fact-checked from <e>Candy</e> was a big moment to me like Obama's tone 2 wks ago. 
<e>Obama</e> should have dropped the mic after that final statement. He completely <a>owned</a> it !! 
Great moderation from Candy Crowley. Mitt seemed cranky and exasperated but President <e>Obama</e> was on point and intolerant of <a>bullshit.</a> #debate 
Sheesh RT @ColbyMarkel: <e>Michelle</e> Obama should give <a>Colb</a> that mouth 
Fuck you if your not <a>voting</a> for <e>Obama!!</e> 
Yeah. So i think <e>Obama</e> <a>won</a> this debate. 
Contentious, but one is telling the truth and the other is <a>lying.</a> <e>Obama=liar.</e> Romney=truth. 
I know y'all won't agree, but I don't care because I love my <a>God.</a> I really think <e>Obama</e> isn't following Him at all and that's the main reason 
<e>Obama</e> <a>won</a> that debate hands down. 
<e>Obama</e> ended with a knockout. The <a>47%</a> comment = the bus driver uppercut! Dont try to explain, Mittens. Just get off the bus!! #POW! #fb 
If to win this debate is to tell the most <a>lies,</a> then <e>Obama</e> won. #townhalldebate

I don't like <e>Obama.</e> But I voted <a>for</a> him. Because, look at the alternative. #Yikes

@RickeySmiley <e>Obama</e> was <a>on</a> <a>topic</a> tonight I think Obama recovered from the first debate, but Romney mad an donkey of himself tonight. 
<e>Obama</e> <a>took</a> this one <a>easy.</a> So Obama/Biden 2 - Romney/Ryan 1 
Dude, <e>Obama</e> <a>brought</a> it tonight. This is the man who should have been here in the first debate 
@chrisrockoz: Mitt Romney: I can't decide which thing <e>Obama</e> did was <a>worse,</a> giving everyone healthcare or saving the auto industry. 
@adammott23 <e>Obama</e> is clearly <a>winning!</a> 
Even though I'm biased, I'm calling this for Romney, but just barely.  Fact checks will show <e>Obama</e> a <a>liar.</a> #tcot #RomneyRyan2012 #debate 
President <e>Obama</e> <a>got</a> this! My TL told me so!!! 
the fact that <e>Obama</e> mentioned Nassau Community College just shows how much he actually <a>cares</a> about this country. LI all the way 
Tonight <e>Obama</e> <a>fought</a> fire with fire but in his cool,  controlled way which makes it much more effective #debate 
Obama <e>needed</e> the moderator to <a>bail</a> him out and also called a man named Kerry "Kerr". lol 
Debate: we are in trouble no matter which way we go , give <e>Obama</e> <a>4</a> more <a>years.</a> 
<e>Obama</e> is <a>killed</a> it tonight I'm so proud of him 
Yes. <e>Obama</e> <a>won.</a> Yes. 
@nickmatthew <e>Obama</e> <a>wins</a> 7-6,4-6,7-5,6-3 
@ConservativeBro I think Romney won,because <e>Obama</e> told several outright <a>lies,that</a> everyone know were lies.Same ol' same ol. 
@iamdiddy revise the question "Hell yeah <e>Obama</e> <a>won</a> the Debate!!!!

@kirstenpowers10 Amazing <e>Obama</e> actually <a>answered</a> a question. 
<e>Obama</e> did <a>work</a> . 
If <e>Obama</e> did mess up this debate, I couldn't tell. He's just that <a>smooth...</a> 
<e>#Obama</e> <a>won</a> that one for sure. #Romney couldn't answer a question without going on the attack. Changed my opinion, Romney is disrespectful! 
<e>Obama</e> <a>bothers</a> me...please stop talking about how great he is. 
<e>Obama</e> for <a>player</a> the year 
<e>Obama</e> <a>gots</a> this! La raza is behind you! 
<e>CNN</e> not trying to let Obama be <a>great</a> 
<e>Romney</e> should wear a best made of gay porn magazines to <a>throw</a> off Obama next time. 
<e>Obama</e> <a>interrupted</a> romney like "hol' up hol' up woah dere my nigga" 
I believe that President <e>Romney</e> will be far <a>worse</a> for USA and the world than George W Bush. Vote #Obama #2012debates 
No one is voting for <e>Obama</e> because he is <a>black</a> I swear to God y'all are so STUPID

<a>Alright</a> <e>Obama...Get</e> the hell out of here. pronto! 
<e>Obama</e> could have easily have said GOML to romney. Obama with the <a>win</a> 
@cedriclabonte Mitt <e>Romney</e> did it (create <a>jobs,</a> balanced <a>budgets</a> and <a>Business</a> turnaround). Obama not. 
<e>Obama</e> <a>killed</a> it haha 
@HeyImDiamond_ girl she pissed me off and she was saying <e>Obama</e> grandparents were <a>rich</a> and other stuff 
<e>Mitt,</e> why didn't you just go up and <a>punch</a> Obama straight in the face? 
@EmmMacfarlane: Ari Fleischer calls it a flat-out draw"... which means you know what..." Ya. <e>Obama</e> just went <a>Honduras</a> on Romney. #CMNT 
Poor <e>Obama</e> felt offended.  He is not used to having to answer for the <a>truth!</a> #debates 
President <e>Obama</e> <a>hit</a> Mitt with an ole fashion Cleveland Uppercut!!! 
Haha I didn't even know <e>Obama</e> has been <a>president</a> for 4 years already.. 
When <e>Obama</e> speaks, you hear the <a>passion</a> in his voice. When Romney speaks, you hear lies. 
<e>Obama</e> Gets His Swagger Back With A Strong <a>Debate</a> Performance Against Romney http://t.co/8Vcv6Eoq #Debate 
@BBCWorld Stronger <e>#Obama</e> but not enough to be a clear <a>winner.</a> 
@SammyRose7 omg <e>she</e> is so obviously <a>biased!</a> It was not fair at all she was consistently helping Obama! I'm so mad 
@TalkMMA he <a>sucked</a> big time if call it a KO for <e>Obama</e> 
Obama and <e>Romney</e> are both terrible candidates, but Romney is less <a>worse</a> 
<e>Obama..</e> sorry but I cant vote for <a>you..</a> unfortunately I'm Canadian 
My <e>grandma</e> said she bout to drop a <a>"g"</a> on Obama!!! Dam wish she could drop it on me!!!! 
<e>Obama</e> <a>could</a> <a>not</a> <a>defend</a> his indefensible record.  #debates 
Gotta say it.....I <a>Love</a> <e>Obama!S/o</e> to all the students who have to write about this Debate and turn it in tomorrow! Go head & knock it out 
@markknoller <e>she</e> was too busy <a>interrupting</a> Romney and trying to help Obama to get rolled. She let O have 4 minutes longer that R. 
Obama got 4 more mins because he kept cutting him off,# <e>Donna</e> Brazile is so <a>stupid</a> 
Half of u niggas only like <e>Obama</e> because he <a>black</a> thats why McCain lost and that's why Romney gone lose 
<e>Obama</e> <a>+4...</a> Th@'s w@'s up!!! Yeah yeah!!!

<e>Obama</e> <a>said</a> chill he got this!!!!!!! 
People don't even know what <e>Obama</e> doing for us they just saying vote for him cause he <a>black.</a> 
Bottom line, <e>Obama's</e> <a>policies</a> have failed for 4 years &, if reelected, there is no reason to expect anything different over the next 4 years 
Thank you, President <e>Obama.</e> You <a>speak</a> for me. 
<e>Obama</e> needs a <a>vacation.</a> 
My take on debate: Obama did better than last debate, but not good enough. <e>Romney</e> held his own. Both had hits & misses, but Romney <a>won.</a> 
<a>Vote</a> for <e>Obama,</e> not just for you but for yo mama! 
<e>Obama</e> <a>suuucks.</a> 
@aidanot34 I <a>vote</a> <e>Obama</e> cause I ain't about the abusive life

<e>Obama's</e> best <a>performance.</a> a strong commander and chief... 
I'm very pleased with President <e>Obama</e> and how he conducted himself at the <a>debate.</a> Job well done! 
@FightForJobs: <e>Obama</e> says he's kept <a>commitments</a> he's made. Agree/Disagree? #FightForJobsdisagree 
@BeirutToJupiter Yeah I saw that :) the content of what <e>Romney</e> was saying seemed more <a>prepared</a> than Obama. The Pres. prob. had a busier day. 
Last political tweet: don't act like ONLY Obama tries to change the subject on questions asked, Mitt does it too. <e>THEY</e> ALL <a>DO</a> IT. #fact 
That <e>debate</e> got <a>heated!</a> Romney almost brought the Chicago out of Obama. I bet he has a cigarette when he gets out of there! Romney, a xanax. 
@FredCuellar You're <e>kidding!...CNN</e> <a>declares</a> Obama the winner??...groundbreaking. 
<e>@BarackObama</e> <a>snuffed</a> Mitt Romney tonight #Forward2012

@BarackObama: President <e>Obama:</e> I said I would end the war in Iraq, and I did." <a>#PromiseKept"</a>

Everyone always talking bad about <e>Obama</e> I mean I am not saying he is doing good but I <a>don't</a> <a>see</a> him doing anything <a>bad!!!</a> 
<e>Obama</e> can't get <a>mad</a> but Romney can? 
@ellencarmichael @mittromney Even more disturbing, seemed like <e>Candy</e> set up every topic to leave last <a>word</a> to Obama 
<e>#Obama</e> is desperate to keep his job as Vacationer In Chief. <a>Lies,</a> lies, lies. #RomneyRyan2012 #GOP2012 #Vote 
<e>Obama</e> is the reason why half of the people around me are even talking about politics now.I'd <a>vote</a> 4 him for that alone #Interesting

From 2009-11, the Obama years, <e>oil</e> production <a>rose</a> two of three years, for a net increase of 10.6 percent 
@JJtheKid30 with Obama as president, <e>hardworking</e> families like ours are being <a>taken</a> from and given to <e>people</e> who dont <a>deserve</a> it 
<e>@crowleyCNN</e> You are an embarrassment. Why'd you <a>help</a> Obama out so much? How'd you get to be a moderator?

This was nothing close to a <e>Tie....Obama</e> <a>won</a> this one. 
@jahollabackgirl <e>Obama</e> was being so <a>rude!</a> She was just doing her job! 
told my dad that I think <e>Obama</e> is hot just to see his <a>reaction</a> #hilarious 
When <e>Romney</e> <a>told</a> Obama to "check your pension," every American under the age of 30 said, "What's a pension?" 
I thought <e>Obama</e> was about to <a>punch</a> Romney for a minute.

The South side Chicago! president came out tonight!! <a>Team</a> <e>Obama!</e>

@MsTerryMcMillan <a>Four</a> more <a>years</a> with President <e>Obama....Yes</e> we can! 
<e>Romney</e> <a>lost</a> this as badly as Obama did the first, but the right wing hacks won't cry and moan.  That's how they win. 
Just so everyone knows, <e>Obama</e> <a>called</a> the attack an act of terror. #NoShitRomney #youlookstupid 
<e>Obama</e> for <a>president</a> 
Real talk <e>Obama</e> makes a lot of <a>good</a> point in which I believe in. 
Republicans are complaining about talk times and criticizing the moderator. <e>Obama</e> <a>won</a> 
I'm not interested in neither party but as far as this election go I do hope <e>Obama</e> <a>wins</a> but this whole shit is ... http://t.co/oeiiuYDF 
@mckenna95 and Romney was? Somehow he got from immigration to <e>Obama's</e> <a>pension...</a> 
GOP is gonna say that Mitt won and <e>Candy</e> showed <a>bias</a> toward Obama. #Debate2012 
<e>Soledad</e> O'Brien needs to start <a>wearing</a> Obama buttons. 
Do I have mostly democratic followers, or is the general consensus that <e>Obama</e> <a>won</a> the #debates? 
@sarahmcsimmons I'm a Democrat and can't wait to vote for Mitt, I only need a few words. The <e>#Obama</e> years have been a <a>failure-he's</a> FIRED! 
<e>I</e> was <a>curious</a> abt the numbers  http://t.co/BAXYGiza President Obama had about 44:04 minutes; Governor Romney had about 40:50 minutes; 
#LT <e>Romney</e> did what he set out to do stand firm solidifying his points and <a>attack</a> Obama's weaknesses 
Thank. God. Media saying <e>Obama</e> <a>won...in</a> Canada, anyways #PresidentialDebate 
Listening to tonight's debate on the radio, President <e>Obama</e> was strong and <a>confident,</a> Governor Romney sounded shifty. I'll vote #Obama 
Eckkk.. <e>I</e> strongly <a>dislike</a> Obama. #teamromney 
Great night for President <e>Obama.</e> Now let's get to work and <a>win</a> this election! #teamobama 
i'm sorry, nope. don't even need to watch the rest. <e>Romney</e> <a>lost</a> debate when Obama got a laugh about gasoline 
<e>Obama</e> had some <a>good</a> points tonight! 
@AndrewSheldon I just think <e>he</e> has a lot more <a>experience</a> than Obama and knows what works and what doesn't. 
@TeamRomney @BarackObama This is bullshit, <a>Team</a> <e>Romney,</e> and you know it. #obamaorbust 
Some <e>people</e> sreiously <a>support</a> Obama <a>blindly.</a> I'm going to sleep. 
<e>Obama</e> is left-handed. I like <a>left-handed</a> people. Lol 
Wish <e>Romney</e> would have <a>reminded</a> Obama about his "You didn't build that" comment when he lied about wanting 2 reward people's success #debate 
My face when I heard <e>Obama</e> <a>won</a> the debate. Pfffft. Sure. http://t.co/rtIshRqC

@BarackObama Couldn't be more <e>proud</e> of <a>Obama!</a> 
<e>I</e> <a>fear</a> for this country if Obama gets reelected... I seriously do :( 
<e>"Obama</e> put us in <a>bad</a> positions these four years" and bush put us in bad positions for 8 and you voted for him twice. 
<e>Obama</e> must have <a>taken</a> <a>lessons</a> from Biden recently #pdslive #debate 
I don't want either <e>Obama</e> or Romney to be our next President. But since one has to <a>win,</a> it better be Obama so I can get fucking married.

But <e>Obama</e> is no different from all the other US presidents as far as <a>policies</a> go,they all about war & lots of injustices. 
@danful38 And Obama said failed <a>policy's</a> of Bush, caused the gas to be low.  Well I guess <e>Obama's</e> failed policy's have let it rise, lol 
Geraldo declares <e>Obama</e> <a>winner</a> by a moustache hair. #debate 
<e>Romney</e> did two silly <a>passes</a> to Obama 1. on Libya and the other on 47% which made Obama closing statement stunning and winning. 
There's still another debate so Im not worried about proclaiming a winner. But <e>Obama</e> realy should seal this w/ <a>Foreign</a> <a>Issues</a> next. 
Romney: Calm, assertive, presidential. <e>Obama:</e> <a>Angry,</a> <a>aggressive,</a> <a>non-presidential.</a> #debate

On FOX News: <e>"Obama</e> hasn't delivered anything...he's been <a>bullsh*tting</a> on everything." Oops. Danger of live TV. 
i feel like tonight during the debate i didn't learn anything about <e>Obama's</e> <a>plan</a> if he wins the election.... #awk 
<e>Obama</e> should regain the lead from his <a>performance</a> tonight. Romney looked desperate. 
In my opinIon <e>Obama</e> has already <a>won</a> . #sorrynotsorry .
