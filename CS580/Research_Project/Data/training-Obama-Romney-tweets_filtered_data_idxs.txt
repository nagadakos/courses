Not even close. A complete reversal from the first debate, Obama winning on every level. Audience connection, emotional appeals, facts. 597

I still laugh at the fact that Obama referred to a "child" as a 21 year old the last debate. 1872
Set the people straight Obama! 1875
Obama claims "low skill" jobs belong overseasâ€¦shows his real lack of concern as it regards having ALL Americans being able to WORK 1876
Obama should say I want world peace and drop the mic! 1877
@jaronjones That exchange was a complete embarrassment for Obama.  He had nothing to say in his defense. 1878
Obama literally just said some jobs aren't coming back and that he doesn't want low-skill jobs. High-skilled industry can't employ everyone. 1879
@tjholmes That case can't be made..Obama 60 Romney 35, and gotta give Candy a High Five (she was subperb) 1880

I'm telling you Obama is illuminate 1907
cannot believe Obama just brought up the 47% thing. 1909
Given how many people think Obama is a communist/socialist, him saying that the  free market is great IS countering a misconception. 1910
So awkward seeing Duran argue with James about Obama on fb right now.. LOL 1911
 Obama just said he believes in self-reliance. That's 100% against all of his policies. He wants people to rely on the government. 1912

President Obama you got my vote #debates 1925
No doubt that Obama talks a better game. But the  both suck. The whole system sucks. Can I vote for a new government? 1926
I'm I the only one that sees similarities between Obama and @TheRock ? 1927
This final Obama hit on the 47 percent comment is his best punch so far. Strong finish for Obama. #debates 1928
Awesome closing remarks for Pres. Obama 1930
@TheLastWord @BarackObama  I wish President Obama would have brought up the fact that the Republicans want to get rid of minimum wage. 1931
You just had to know that Obama would close with a 47% jab. 1932
Obama talks so slow... 1933

Obama came out guns blazing! I believe he won this debate. 1948
Absolutely... RT @foreveryagirl I think #Obama did a much better job in this debate vs the last one #Obama2012 1950
#Obama saves the best for last. Brings up 47% remark at the end of the debate. Last thing everyone hears. He slams #MittTheTwit! #debate2012 1952
Yeah Obama never called it a terrorist attack in the rose garden. Called it an "attack" that's pretty broad Barack 1953
I love the love the Obama's show for each other ðŸ‘« 1954
Yes, first lady Michelle Obama is always on point. 1957
â€œ@blakeburkett: If Obama is re-elected, I'm going to purchase my first gun.  End of story.  #RomneyRyan2012â€ Amen! 1958

Obama spoke more than 3 minutes longer than Romney tonight #debates 1960
@SuzBrockmann I feel like that was just a game of Mortal Kombat, and when Obama said 47% the words "finish him" came on my screen. 1962
Close debate, but I think Obama took it. 1965
This was a great debate! Good job Obama! 1967
Now that's the assertiveness I want to see from President Obama. 1969
President #Obama was better, he was more specific, confident. MSNBC it might be easily considered Obama's best debate performance. 1970
Hempstead brought out the aggression in Obama 1971

Number one reason I hate Obama? Because killing a child should never be legal, even if you consider it just a 'group of cells'. 1974

And debate number 2 goes to Barack Obama! #4MoreYears 1997
Obama won this debate. He was in total control. 1998

I think it's safe to say Obama #slayed 2159
Obama dominated the debate. Nice to see he is back :) #Obama #CNNDebate 2162
Obama won 2164
I think Obama came on strong tonight 2165
wish audience had asked Obama why he did not do all the things he continues to pledge to do if given 4 yrs 2168
C'mon, @arifleischer. We both know #Obama didn't talk ab his plans because HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY. #debate #cnn 2169
@mehdirhasan he probably believes that Obama doesn't believe in the same god as he does or that Obama is a Muslim. 2174
@xoxo_MonaeLove Again he helped FIX that economy after Obama let the entire Nations economy crash and led to all state economies crashing 2175
#Obama went over time. The host said time was up. His reply "this is important" IT'S also important 2 follow the rules #presidentialdebate 2179
The truth squad #Obama 2182
Obama >>>>> 2183
Every time I see someone say "name one thing Obama did" my response will be "lol bin laden" 2184
Sounds like Obama won the debate #IDidntWatchIt #BetterThingsToDo 2185
Obama won the debate decisively. http://t.co/c9mCQT56 2188
Obama sure tries to make himself look better by lying.. He needs to try a lot harder.! #2012PresidentialDebate 2191
 Voted today 4 #Obama #iowavoting #Obama2012 #needsomeonewitharealplan 2193
David Plouffe is exactly why Obama can't get 4 more years. #tool 2194
Obama got dis!!! #TEAMObama 2196
So true! But then there are some people who like Obama for welfare, but they're not poor, just too lazy to get a job you know? @Jayadiva39 2199
@KatieeB_ people who think Obama's health care ideas are a good thing need a nice slap across the back of the head........... With a shovel. 2200
On that last response by Obama....that boy went Jordan...Game 6 *Jay-Z Voice* 2201
Thats a #Win for #Obama 2202
#Obama 2204
@andyeisenbacher We cannot keep going I. The direction we have been going... Obama and those before him! 2206
â€œ@TheDemocrats: We're proud to be #TeamBarackâ€”RT if you are too.â€ #Obama 2207
So Obama in the last debate got it handed to him:-)  he actually tried this time and I'd still give the edge to Romney #gomitt 2208
Watched the debate, obviously. I find Obama's energy policy laughable when earlier he said he planned to increase energy prices. 2209
RT: ABC and Fox Fact Check Obama:  Oil & Gas Drilling Permits ARE Down 60% Under Obama. #debates #utpol 2211
â€œShe works for me. Iâ€™m the president. And Iâ€™m always responsible.â€ - President Obama, taking responsibility fâ€¦ http://t.co/pMiSfhF9 2212
Obama, look bud, you cant make up lies about what someone just say two mins ago.. Recorded dumbass! 2213
The moment Obama won! http://t.co/Z3U9cGob 2214
Why do people think things are gonna get better if Obama is re-elected? It will be the exact same as the last 4 years. I don't understand. 2215
Obama or civil war 2216
Read the transcript. RNC chair accuses Obama of lying about Libya and moderator "aided and abetted." 2217
So why does Obama get props for bin laden, but doesn't get held responsible for unemployment, he inherited both, be fair I'm that 2218
That was fun!! I wish I had some snacks tho. Vodka flowing and fearing for the morning. Obama is back, Spain is in the clear, Greece is TOST 2223
As I predicted Democrats would say Obama won overwhelmingly. I am shocked Democrats would say their candidate won. 2225
#Obama wants to reinstate "assault weapons" ban. I'm glad that's on the record. #guncontrol 2226
@JustCeeC: President Obama should have dropped the mic and wall off stage after that last answer! I'd drop the mic for him. Lol 2227
#PDSLive republicans control the Oil. They raise the prices to make it look like Obama is doing badly. Even though we have surpluses 2228
@RyanSeacrest President Obama. 2229
Obama did good tonight 2230
Romney just got roasted. Deny it all you want ,republicans, but a monkey could judge that Obama won #debate2012 2231
@neaboo89 the problems Obama didn't create 2232
Obama has appeared weak and tired in several recent public forums. I wonder if he actually even wants to be president anymore... 2234
Obama talked louder, but didn't tell us what he would differently than he is already doing. Talked a lot,but said nothing. An empty suit. 2235
It's funny how these retired senators that are republicans are endorsing Obama 2236
I only wish Obama would have shown this vigor during the last debate! #Debate2012 2237
Obama keeps my hope alive in good men. 2239
Binder-women & "My pension is not as large as yours" will be the 2 memorable quotes from tonight's #debate. It's a draw edging toward Obama. 2240
@T_Bevs HAHA! Vote Obama! For Murphy Brown!! 2243
Obama's got this one in the bag #likecomeon #hehasamovie 2247

We  we confess that humility clothes President Obama and goodness and mercy are following him. Psalm 23 2252
Political beliefs aside, Obama belatedly lied about Libya. There is no denying it. The man has ZERO character. 2254
#foxnews krauthhammer says Obama won! 2255

President Obama was concise and to the point. Round 2 goes to him. 2278
Obama's a champ 2279

@iRoqueKurls my coworker are going in on president Obama... I wish I could show you what some if them are thinking... 2281
MSM is basically saying that Obama won this one because he wasn't as lousy as he was last time. 2282
Remember when Obama said 4 years ago that he was gonna cut national debt in half? That's funny because its almost doubled #idiot 2283
80% say Obama won #kewl 2285
@ZachMarin34 Obama definitely learned from the first debate! 2287
I could get to watch about half of the debate...What I felt Mr. President, Obama's sincerity...I support Obama.  He is a good man! 2288
Man I hope Obama win though.. 2291
People need to understand the US Government's process before they bash Obama. Things that haven't been achieved are not from lack of effort 2292
Obama was terrific, now for the win... 2293
@moonyzhang aren't you sided with Obama too ? 2295
@edshow President Obama won. Willard kept going back to talking points & lies. Bet the righties didn't mind his interrupting. 2296
Obama gets alot of votes for being mixed. Don't lie. 2297
Obama came on strong tonite.  Showed he is commander in chief. 2299

@BarackObama President Obama showed his strength tonight. A lot of factually facts were stated from the President. Great job!!!! 2334
i really wish i could vote for Obama :'( 2335
What can't be argued is that what Obama has done over the past four years hasn't worked. Plain and simple 2337
@Hrothgar_KP the situation for young white college grads under Obama is only going to get worse...much worse...ive studied economics 2338
@chrisrockoz second round knock out Pres Obama. 2339
If Obama thought Libya was an act of terror, why did he & his staff come out on numerous tv shows for 2 WEEKS citing a video was to blame?!! 2340
@tiffanyshlain #Debates "Float like a butterfly,sting like a bee" #Obama 's 47 point knockout in the last round was just like #MuhammadAli . 2341
 Liberals are thinking that Obama won as clearly this time he was awake #debates #laughable 2343
Didn't even watch the debate because I can't stand listening to Obama make excuses for the hundreds of thousands of lazy Americans we have. 2344
@1rutwilldo yeah. Obama's response to initial question was weak. The follow up question got a little weird. 2347
Obama hit a grand slam tonight, look for a 3-4 point bounce! Congrats Mr President 2349
Obama got a good point 2350
My Pop was 2 stepping, yelling "Obama' earlier around the house! Now he's really excited to vote, like it's his first time! Lol 2351

Moderator was way out of line helping Obama with the Libya lie!  OMG 2363
@LCoop34: Obama is a great speaker 2364
@seanhannity Totally agree. Obama had nothing to bring to the debate. 2365
@kadeemedwards Well I don't even have something funny for this. I guess whatever Obama wants to do he can do, because he has heat vision. 2366
I'm Tired Of Hearing Ppl Say The UnEmployment Rate Has Increased Since Obama Became President... 2367
@mblessing2 yeah she made him doubt his facts on which he was correct on, its because Candy has almost parralel views to Obama on the topic 2373
I dont understand #Obama lies when there is fact check. We are going to find out the truth so why lie? 2374
Wow RT @Mike_notmichael: But... RT @LsKSwagSwag Obama deserves another 4 years. If he can't get the job done after that then he gotta go 2377
â€œ@JCarrizales_5: â€œ@NatalyyDee: I don't want Obama to win.â€ #Carrizales4Presidentâ€ .. Obama please win! 2378
The fact Obama is probably the first president to have teenagers watch the debate >> 2379
What has Obama done in the last four years to improve America! Nothing! He lost the debate!!! 2381
I think the point of this debate is, you can't beat Obama, unless you're Obama^2. #fb 2382
Checked into Fox News to see how they're handling their candidate's defeat...Hannity vows to "fact check Obama's lies" 2383
Wow - this group didn't think Obama performed well at all. 'Just attacked' & had no ideas, didn't answer questions & was totally on defense. 2384

 I hope I can catch a replay from the debates. Sounds like it was great for Obama. 3012
 So...the theory that Obama threw the first debate to make his effort in the second one seem more impressive is certainly looking viable.. 3013

 @russllj Obama was really good this evening. I was smiling! 3107
 @megynkelly I was uncomfortable with Obama's stand -up & interrupt routine. It was a well-practiced rudeness that failed as strength. 3108

 @realDonaldTrump Obama was more of a boistrous bull spouting out the same old things that he DIDN'T achieve in 4 years and can't in 4 more. 3196
 @PaulRyanVP Ask America why the press has never ask Obama the tough questions these last 4 years. 3197

 @TheTimmyTebow  Try to find something good to say about somebody if u can but lv Obama alone. It's not flattering to u. 3217
 I don't appreciate how Obama capitalisizes on the fact that he's black. 3218
 @BillPhill12 Omg, that was the funniest thing ever - and every person struggling in Obama's economy wanted to say it, too. 3219
 AllI can say about last night's debate is that Obama looked pretty desperate. 3220
 Obama called Romney an Azzhole!  #Funny 3221

 Obama did a great job 3276
 Obama won the debate 3277
 @ewilliam_ Obama record on what he promised and failed to do hurts him 3278
 One thing is clear…Obama legitimately does not like Romney as a person. He finds Mitt's success contemptible. #debates 3280
 @KimPinkx3 Obama is a huge supporter of community college 3283
 Idgaf if Obama is black, that's NOT a reason why we are voting for him! He's just amazing all around 3284
 Clearly Obama won! #debate2012 #obama #democrats #leggo 3285
 president Obama is the first president to get teenagers and young adults involved in watching the debate and want to vote 3286
 Obama has a lot of support. 3287
 @Lil3jmg My parents think Obama is the worst thing to ever happy to the United States. So glad I don't share the views as they do. 3288
 Proud to be a registered voter right about now, damn right I am voting for Obama again.......who mad? 3290
 @greggutfeld Obama had four more minutes of LIES!!! #debate 3291
 BREAKING: Shortly after the debate, Obama and Moderator Candy Crowley seen giving each other a high-five... #tcot #p2 #debate 3292
 I honestly don't want Obama or Romney to win. 3293
 Don't expect me to defend Obama's policies & broken promises. Like I said, blind political allegiance is funny. "@a_tweet_life @Al_Gorelioni 3295
 I think Obama is secretly a terrorist. His name scares me. "Barack Obama" come on son'! 3296
 Y'all see this shit --->"@5hannnnnon: Obama shut up you nigger. You're a liar. Your brother lives in Kenya where you were born. #Romney2012" 3297
 @Dakota_bruhh in all honesty, what has changed in your life to make you mad at Obama? 3298
 I say we have a hunger games politics style Obama vs Romney an throw Ron Paul and Herman Caine in there for kicks 3299
 Everyone Is Entitled To Their Own Opinions.. But I'm Proud To Say That I'm Voting For Obama. #thatisall 3300
 I've seen 3 Presidents look at and lie to the American people. Nixon, Clinton, now Obama. Obama's lie involved the death of four people. 3301
 This quote is for everyone who voted for Obama in 2008. "Fool me once shame on you. Fool me twice shame on me." #Romney2012 3302
 President Obama lied to the American population tonight. Dug a whole new hole for him on this Lybia thing. #Debates 3303
 Ed Gillespie: "For every job Obama admin created, 6 people left the workforce".  #debates 3305
 "99% of Obama's policies didn't work. Just like the people that voted for him." 3307
 Obama-Thanks for answering questions in the first minute of your turn instead of walking around them..... #abcpolitics 3308
 Obama shut up your a liar. Romney shut up your a liar. 3309
 Polls say Obama 46% vs Romney 39%. #debates 3312
 Even in 2008, Obama didnt statistically show he was a good enough candidate for Dew. 3314
 @aegies @BarackObama If i had the money and wasn't so broke because of college, i'd top that with $200. Obama's got my full support and vote 3315
 @itsKirenbitch Obama is classy as fuck. I wish I was American so I could vote for him. 3316
 I love how Obama brought in the hiring of teachers into the AK47 question. WTF? For the record hiring more gov doesn't grow the economy. 3317
 THIS WILL GET YO ASS BEAT"@5hannnnnon: Obama shut up you nigger. You're a liar.Your brother lives in Kenya where you were born. #Romney2012" 3320
 @DavidLimbaugh Obama not as compelling a liar as Clinton was. Not to mention media monopoly is not the same. 3321
 @akinfolaju how do u do... Didn't watch it but using wat I have read so far it was a good nite for Obama 3322
 "I know people that have healthcare because of Obama." ... "I know people that have jobs because of Obama." (via @jferg & @benjaminkelley) 3324
 Obama totally ignored nor really nswered questions on Benghazi or "Fast & Furious"!  And MSM says he "won"? LOL 3326
 Obama wins the 2nd debate! (Once the conservative commentators go for the moderator you know their candidate lost) 3327
 #Obama is the truth. 3333
 @AlexisClewis24 and like I said I dot care who president is.. But Obama sure as hell didnt do a good job fixing ANYTHING 3334
 @AshleyOkinawa lld I didn't say anything to harm their party, Romney did that for himself.I just commented on Obama! 3336
 @gaylortangg and Obama has strikingly similar ideologies to Jimmy Carter and Karl Marx, both of whom know nothing of successful nations. 3338
 Obama did not answer the question on Libya. Romney missed the opportunity to demand an answer n the moderator didnt demand an answer either! 3339
 "@coledixon15: Obama is a self centered jackass that needs to take his foreign ass back to his Muslim countries." @llcoollittle & this guy 2 3340
 @RNCResearch Heck it wasn't the lies that are the problem, it was the lack of ideas from Obama, so another four years of the same. 3342
 The Republican goal is not to beat Obama down. It's to shake down and beat down the American people. Keep your heads up. Obama 2012. 3343
 If I have to listen to one more Obama speech, I think I will end up in a loony bin. What a grating voice. 3344
 If Obama wasn't running for president would you still be excited about politics? 3345
 From assault rifles to education, Obama you are OWNING this debate. Brilliant public speaker, just fucking brilliant. 3346
 I am so pumped up right now. I cannot even sleep. #TeamObama - tonight we saw why we are going to do everything we can to reelect #Obama 3347
 Bringing manufacturing back question: Romney - China is a cheat and a thief. #yellowperilObama - invest in advance manufacturing, R&D, tech 3348
 Will @BarackObama EVER correct Romney? The vast majority of that deficit is Bush's--particularly his 2 wars Obama finally put on the books! 3349
 Listen Obama, Wallstreet and the big car companies you bailed out are in the same league. Quit blaming other people for your problems. 3351
 Finally just watched the debate on DVR.  Heated and what I have been waiting for, Obama was on the defensive for most of it. 3352
 I will admit, #Bush's spending was out of control. But Obama's spending habits... just completely unacceptable #NotFittoGovern #Debate2012 3354
 Obama you got Morgan Freeman to be spokesman on one of your commercials? Well since you got God to speak highly of you, you will win. 3355
 Obama did lower taxes on middle class. No Job, No Money, Lower Taxes #lnyhbt 3356
 @lindaph1 Hell Obama can't even take care of one border patrol agent how can he handle diplomatic security? BHO Admin. is a chinese cluster. 3357
 Barack Obama wins the debate. Bristol Palin voted off Dancing With The Stars. It's a great night to be a liberal in America! 3359
 Election news, CNN calls it for Obama. FOX News calls it for Romney. Adult Swim calls it a clear victory for Meatwad. 3365
 Today's Presidential Debate ws OK. For me, #Obama is a winner today by an Inch, jst 1 inch. He shud b more Charged up in d nxt &last rd. 3366
 Obama whooped both Romney and the moderator! Dayummmm #Obama2012 3368
 Taliban shot #Malala for her ideal was #Obama, All female fans of Brad Pitt, Justin Bieber etc should be careful in Pakistan 3369
 Wondering how polls can say Obama won the debate but Romney won on issues.  It's hard to understand polling at times! #perception #debate 3370
 Obama's voice is so assuring. 3372
 Heard Obama used Biden's acting coach - who evidently specializes in LYING & goofy looking fake aggression with angry eyes! 3374
 @KevinMcGil Whoooooooooaaa, Nellie! :-) RT FOX News poll has Obama winning tonight's #debate by 70%. @barackobama @davidaxelrod @joenbc 3376
 Oi why are Americans so ignorant? I think Obama is better than any other past president 3378
 Only watched enough of the debate to form an intitial impression, basically Obama walked in like a pimp and ate that face. 3379
 Wait for the foreign policy debate.@stretch4444 I wish Romney had brought up the multitude of daily briefings missed by Obama ! 3380
 Michelle #Obama broke debate rules by cheering when moderator lied about #Libya to save Barack's butt. #MSMBias 3384
 @ItsEmaxSnitches Who will win, Obama or Romney? click @VotetoWin_2012 and follow the link in her description! 3385
 The #Obama legacy:  Bad Policies = Poor Results = Gloomy Future. Would you really rehire him to make sure this happens?#Romney 3387
 Students have been camping out all night to see Obama and more students are beginning to line up! 3388
 I'm not racist but Obama needs to remember that a white man built this land. A black man sold his families to the white man. 3389
 @AidanLicks but if you want government to have less power, Obama should be your biggest enemy 3390
 Mr. President please stop the cover up. You did not call it a terrorist attack until 2 weeks after the attack. We have the transcript @Obama 3391
 @GMA who wrote this? Badly worded question. Obama won. 3392
 Interesting, too, that President Obama called Mitty on his "Social Ideas"-- BECAUSE  SOCIAL = PEOPLE and NOT CORPORATIONS ! 3393
 Obama calls out on Romney about his investment on companies (Bain Capital) outsourcing American jobs to China (Sensata plant in Illinois)... 3394
 #debate Rose garden presidential statement (3:53 mark) Obama says "All Americans always.." clearly not talking specifically of Benghazi 3395
 @keder False statemen. Obama had 14, Mitt Romney had 2, Crowley had 1. Obama wins on falsehoods #debate2012 3396
 @jay33231 just listening to Obama talk and blatantly lie is enough to make me want to vomit over and over again 3397
 White folks treasure being considered an honorary member of an oppressed people. A Republican coworker voted Obama to keep his hood card. 3398
 Best thing about the debate? If Obama thinks he won the first, he'll have a similarly distorted impression of the second. 3399
 Yes, Barack Obama LIED last night. On September 12 he was blaming a video, not terrorism, for Libya. LIED. #mapoli 3400
 EVERY American knows lots of people who are out of work since Obama was elected. THAT will get him fired! 3401
 If Obama wins this election because of women's issues...I lose faith in my gender. #prolife #smallgovernment #RomneyRyan12 3402
 Obama26Obama Let's hope WHEN Obama is overturned, he ends up on welfare and food stamps. ) 3404
 Why is the media is claiming a win for Obama? Actually being awake this debate doesn't count. I like him even less, he acted like a jerk. 3405
 Obama SHOULDN'T have to keep reassuring his base after last night. Please let him speak2&secure the independent& undecideds w/out criticism 3406
 #debate If Obama had been telling the truth last night, he might have won.  America loses when a President lies to our face! #RomneyRyan 3407
 For a man with 4 years on the job, pres Obama seems to be very uncertain and lacking of conviction. 3408
 Great debate for Obama last night I gotta say title of one of my newest song is what went down and that is (I Don't Run From Nobody) 3409
 @GayPatriot Obama is answering questions from US Weekly followers today. Let's overwhelm him with tough questions! 3410
 Final proof Obama won the debate, #FoxNews is "raising questions" about  Candy Crowley as moderator. #p2 #topprog #tcot 3411
 truth-Obama failed on emigration reform,but the republicans did to-they never gave any help even when they got what they wanted. 3412
 Why did Romney say unemployment rates have gone up since Obama took office? Wasn't there that study last week that said they'd gone down? 3413
 According to him, I'm what's wrong with society because I think comparing Obama to Hitler is disgusting and makes no sense. 3414
 President Obama is worth 12million and has money over in china 3415
 .@AndrewRugg Predictably, the NYTimes and CNN have declared Obama the winner and those are the MSM headlines. 3416
 Obama lied about Libya and production of coal.  Obama claimed he has signed more permits  for coal. Not true, People in WV are unemployed 3419
 @whoisdemichael actually, when Obama was a senator, he proposed the bills & approved the plans that are responsible for our nation's debt. 3420
 @Daggy1 Obama didn't. Went straight into education. High end jobs. Prob there is. High end = low volume. We got that now in Ireland. 3421
 @DETECTIVE4LIFE @davidwebbshow yes, #Obama had rage in him, felt bad for man in audience who asked question. Out of control n too defensive 3422
 Don't live in America so it doesn't concern me but I want to see Obama lose just to see what Romney can do in 4 years 3423
 @SydneyREDtaylor I don't think either of them are talking about taking away financial aid but I do think Obama has helped with that a lot. 3424
 They just said "Obama has really been pounding hard" on the news, do they even listen to themselves when they talk? haha 3425
 @Semkae I guess u didn't read the links I sent u. Even conservatives like Krauthammer and Laura Ingraham said Obama won @omarilyas @chiume 3428
 Obama is gonna outsource low paying jobs (most of y'all) Create more High skilled jobs. (NONE of y'all) 3431
 Obama hits back in fiery debate: A more aggressive Barack Obama buries the memory of a poor first showing as he and challenger Mitt R... 3432
 Obama's #failingagenda is burying the middle class and hurting families! RT if you agree and read more from AFP Prez @TimPhillipsAFP!! 3434
 Obama cannot run on his record and 4 more years would be a repeat of 1st 4 years @DishFeed 3435
 All of the Obama supporters keep asking for specifics of Romney's plan. I'm just asking for Obama to present any bit of a plan. 3438
 @brad4rdr  Fox News says Romney won. Given their record of accuracy, we can be confident that Obama did. 3439
 Yes Obama is DESTROYING the MYTH of White genetic & intellectual Superiority and? @jawbreakerctc01 @REM63489 @bootyisyou @BarackObama TKCAL 3441
 Well just found out Obama used to be a pot head #blowingupintheovaloffice 3442
 The only thing I understand about politics is that I hate Obama #nohope 3443
 FTD is irking the hell outta me. Buy flowers ONCE, and they parked their asses in my inbox like Obama. 3444
 "@WSJ: According to polls of undecided voters, Barack Obama narrowly won last night's presidential #debate." A narrow win is still a win! 3447
 President Obama's little trips to Virginia are really cramping my flight plans. 3448
 @TheSlimmyMan @evalongoria How did Obama win! Please explain. He didn't answer a single question he was asked? 3449
 @emilyctamkin You'll never see them post something like, "Well Hugo Chavez endorsed Obama, so LOOK AT WHAT OBAMA'S VOTING BASE REPRESENTS." 3450
 Ultimate irony!!! @Chris_Moody Obama to crowd in Iowa: "I certainly don't think politicians should control the health care that you get." 3451
 Obama is losing the election based on his last 4 years of lack luster performance. He has a history now. VOTE #mitt2012 lets get jobs moving 3452
 "I consider it a part of my responsibility as president of the United States to fight against negative stereotypes of Islam." - Barack Obama 3453
 Enslaves people to the government just like what Obama wants to do in this country 3454
 I will soon. Just sat down for the 2016 Obama's America movie. 3455
 Romney doesn't have a five point plan, he has a one point plan - Obama ...That's right call his bullshit!  3456
 @ChicGrl427 @RepubGrlProbs I don't think Obama won, but I see your point. 3459
 Biden on debate last night: Obama showed himself as "a man of principle, a man of  gumption, with a steady hand and a clear vision." 3461
 Romney's history of hiring women from his binders is noteworthy, Obama's history of hiring from welfare list not so much.  Your choice. 3462
 & Yessss Obama won last night debate :) 3463
 @americasvoice  are Latinos Libs fucking insane?It's Obama policies which have resulted in record deportations&S-Comm of millions Mexicanos! 3465
 Anyone see the irony on the left proclaiming this big debate victory when Obama lied to pretend he was practically a conservative? #teaparty 3466
 Everybody taking about i love Obama,i love Romney and I'm like,I LOVE WEED!! 3469
 I hope BravoTV hosts a Real Presidents Reunion series with Romney and Obama after the election #debate 3470
 Obama doing a wonderful job. 3471
 "Governor Romney you don't have a 5 point plan, you have a 1 point plan" @BarackObama that was a good one. #Debates 3472
 @JoeBiden Obama won the debate by a landslide 3473
 @KeithMcCullough @daytrend  IF Obama won, it was with the help of the moderator. I call that cheating. 3474
 @cavuto I'm a small business owner and think Obama's policies are great. P.s stop reporting alleged attack as end the world! 3475
 @zanzerjewel Who will win, Obama or Romney? click the link in the profile of @VotetoWin_2012 to vote now 3476
 @washingtonpost have you dummies still not realized, as CNN has already said, that mitt Romney did not misstep. @BarackObama lied again 3477
 I'm voting for Obama. Even thought he did not fulfill all othe promises due to tough making decions he still helped us in some serious ways. 3479
 Obama have Teenagers watching the "Presidential Debate " ! He's the first President to do that! That's what you call  making CHANGES ! 3480
 And Obama is the savior who is going to bring world peace to the world. 3481
 @hardball James #Lipton to Chris #Matthews:America has a choice--does she want a president or a boss...and I mean a boss. #Obama #Romney 3482
 @EvaLongoria @NathanFillion you got to be kidding... Obama lies-When his lips are moving.  Should be tried for treason, impeached and jailed 3483
 Obama: you want some votes?  Legalize weed. Free boosie. Before Romney do it. 3484
 @JeffersonObama Well Obama is doomed bcz he will lose TX, AL and MS :( lol 3485
 @gretawire People are realizing what a failure Obama has been.Hopefully more will smarten up! 3486
 My aunty said she votin fa Mitt Romney , caus Obama be smoking too much caus his lips blk... Lmmfao ! 3487
 I find it very interesting that Obama criticizes Romney for having a large pension. I guess he thinks success is bad. That's the Obama way. 3488
 When they were talking about immigration, Romney called them "illegal." Obama called them "undocumented." It's the little things. 3492
 Key difference between Romney & President Obama is Romney talks about WHAT he's going to do while Obama talks about HOW he's going to do it. 3493
 I guess everybody i follow is voting for Obama,  cus everybody bad mouthing Romney lol 3494
 Too many people on the Obama bandwagon solely because he's black. 3495
 @Trollpecki I thought this was Romney v Obama, not Romney v Candy and Barry 3497
 Whats the Difference...between Obama and a Monkey..?The Monkey has smaller ears.LOOOOOOOOOOL.Nah I kid. But forreal..tho Fuck Politics. 3500
 Hey Obama! you export inflation to the world you dick! #YouHaveNoBrain 3502
 Obama wants to lower corporate tax rate? News to me... #debate 3503
 I believe the moderator is slightly favoring Obama #ohwell #notmad #heisthepresident 3504
 Obama questions Romney's commitment to women's health care, pointing to the Republican's vow to eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood. 3505
 @Jadore_Elidja @santi_41 Mr.pena I think you should go for Obama now. (Not that I'm anyone to say but after that, just sayin) 3506
 If you or ya folks ain't rich, and you got loans, yo ass need to be tryna vote for Obama 2 or 3 times! lol #SallieMaeAintNoHoe lmaoo 3507
 Is it bad that one of the reasons that I like Obama (in a politically unbiased way) is that he wears nice suits? #shallow 3510
 Romney great answer on foreign competition, Obama-there you go again, give me 4 more years & I'll do better next time, trust me 3511
 Obama only makes sense 3514
 To make this debate more interesting Obama just needs to start rapping  #justsaying 3515
 @ilaffalot Nah I think Romney's gunna throw a punch at Obama. It's getting heated! 3516
 Seriously... Obama is not going to bring up the 47 percent remark? 3517
 Just heard my dad say "Obama shut up"  hahaha. How bout we say fuck both these old dudes. Vote for real freedom#SamRussellForPresident 3518
 @TrIzZySpaCedOuT and if you were actually interested I would ask you to tell me the bad things Obama has done as president. 3519
 I think the only people stupid enough to vote for Obama again are the ones who can vote for the first time this year #smfh #getout #NObama12 3520
 Romney is getting drowned out by both Obama and Crowley! #debate 3522
 Ahaha did that mediator lady really just back up Obama and shit on Romney?! At a girl! 3523
 I wish I could just hug President Obama and tell him every little thing will be okay. 3526
 Obama is good if he got the tennage community watching this debate 3527
 No doubt #Obama has gotten more time to talk. Yet if #Romney goes over by a few seconds, the President gripes to #Candy. #Debate 3528
 Some black people our age may or may not vote for Obama, but MOST older black people out of school, working, or retired will vote for him. 3529
 According to Obama, Schools(gun free zones) are the answer to F&F. What a putz.  #2012debate 3530
 I'm at work. What did Obama do that made everyone lose their shit? 3532
 The press room busted out laughing when Obama said " my pension isnt as big as yours " LOL , Good comeback dawg ! 3533
 @DivaStateOvMind I don't even care about all of this forreal....but Obama won this one! lol....Kilt that perfect hair Mitt! lol 3534
 Every American that I follow is obviously impressed that Obama is president.. -___- 3535
 Obama says he believes in self reliance? What a joke! He believes in a nanny state! 3537
 #PresDebate There! Obama said it. The 47 percent. His closer. 3538
 And Democrats finally breathe as Obama says "47 percent" 3539
 Notice how Obama didn't need to be told to stop. 3540
 Much better Obama 3541
 Obama wins, hands down! #current2012 3542
 I just want Obama to read a bedtime story to me. I love listening to him speak. 3543
 Oh, so now Obama cares about the military? That's funny, wasn't he just photographed saluting Marines while on the phone? Right. #BS 3544
 Obama is so cute! :') I love him. 3545
 President Obama Is Great Man && He Deserves More Respect Then Romney Is Giving Him ! 3546
Obama is now pandering! Since when does he believe in free enterprise? 3547
 Yay President Obama did it hands down!!!! Yeah buddy 3548
 Obama kicked ass in this debate in my opinion. #debates 3549
 Black people make up a bunch of bullshit excuses to cover up the fact that they voting for Obama kuz he black lol that sh** be too hilarious 3551
 I will never stop loving watching the First Couple.  No one can ever say that Obama doesn't love his wife! #debate 3553
 Ughhh Obama's voice makes me cringe #youareannoying #idonotlikeyou 3554
 @JenGranholm Obama cool as the ice in my freezer cnt wait until the War Room tomorrow!! 3556
 Obama killed it man. Good job on proving that factual error by your opponent. I'm proud.  3557
 "And that's how you debate biatch" - President Obama as he looks at Romney and drops the mic and leaves the stage. #DNC2012 #GOP2012 #tcot 3559
 Obama's most important job is CINC. He failed in his mission with Benghazi. He lost. He should be fired. Everything else is window dressing. 3560
 Obama must have gotten really high oral marks in english when he was in highschool. Probably roasted the fuck out of everyone. 3561
 Classic all the moderators thus far have all been die hard liberals pulling for Obama and Mitt still wrecks him. 3563
 Romney asking Obama if he has funds offshore, Obama's face was like bitch I barely got funds inshore lol 3564
 @Ed @stevenportnoy @ABCNewsRadio I cant believe my ears!! What is wrong with people? They are so pro Obama they are def and blind 3565
 Wow! Great job Obama.What a comeback. Lol#PresidentialDebate 3568
 Or Obama or mit or big big bird or the economy or food stamps or the pell grant or jobs or education NOTHING!!! 3569
 Obama won that debate guys. 3570
 Obama won that shit! #TeamObama 3571
 I love how Obama threw out that he thinks his daughters should have the same opportunities as "anyone else's" sons.... 3572
 Great debate performance by President Obama! Much improved from last time 3573
 Obama won that #debate hands down!!! Vote @barackobama!!! 3574
 @MonicaBrown FYI 47 percent are ecstatic about President Obama's performance tonight Mitt Romney. Our President is the truth! 3575
 @Foobian no matter who the fuck our president is and I think that if Obama stays in office that things will get better eventually... 3576
 Everyone seems so close minded, either Obama or no one and that's it and that makes you ignorant, we need to know both sides 3577
 Obama - Same rudeness and arrogance that has been part and parcel of this presidency. Vote the bum out. 3578
 Very impressed with #Obama tonight. Much more engaged and prepared. No doubt about my vote #ObamaBiden2012 3579
 @zachbraff @donald_faison I just realized if you 2 had a baby, he'd probably look like Obama in 50 years. 3581
 When all I see is Romney this and Obama that on my feeds, I'm doing something that truly matters. #breakingbad #season3 3582
 @NickBarnett I'm going to church President Barack Obama. 3584
 @RyanSeacrest Pres. Obama Did.. He had his game on tonight 3585
 Why has nobody given me a direct quote on Obama's closing statement? I want to be in on the 47% reference too. #spoiled #twitterdebates2012 3586
 Debate No. 1: Dems admit Obama lost. Debate No. 2: Republicans cry that the moderator wasn't fair. #manup 3587
 Not into this type of stuff but bouta vote for the 1st time #Obama 3588
 Yall hate Obama because of gun control laws...he isn't taking it away just making it harder for those who don't need them 3589
 B. Clint training Obama haaaard on how to lie to the American ppl. And on facial expressions. 3590
 Well tonight Obama has something in common with the Yankee's. They're both losing. 3591
 Voting for #Obama im behind him a 1,000,000% 3593
 Obama always linked Benghazi to Cairo in order to link it with the video. He clearly did not call it a planned act or terrorism. 3594
 I want Obama b/c I look forward to my daughter growing up & saying, "Ugh. We don't have enough men on staff. Go get my binders full of men." 3595
 @AceofSpadesHQ @jaycosttws @michellemalkin @noltenc "No acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great nation..."-Pres. Obama 3596
 Candy Crowley didn't do Obama any favors by lieing for him on Libya. Everybody and the world knows the truth 3597
 @EmilyPurserSky Obama fought for his job last night and he may have convinced voters to give him another shot! @JCBua @SkyNews 3598
 @ChristiAnne67 wow...I think the left press has fooled you. Obama looks like a staunch conservative in comparison 3599
The fuck wrong wit us voting for obama cuz he black all them white people in the house let us fuckn live 3600
3 months, 3 days, 16 hours, 59 minutes, and 58 seconds  until #Obama leaves office. 3603

Gon head President Obama lol :) 5569
I hate political analyists sometimes, because they be making Obama look bad. 5570
President Obama signing autographs with that left hand. Yum!  So attractive! 5571
Obama Body Language again  - looking for his teleprompter and just rambling on 5572
Obama killed it. #fourmoreyears 5573
Yo wife is ugly Romney , she don't have nothing on the flawless Michelle Obama 5574
@FoCrealdoe Obama grew up in Hawaii. 5575
Obama won!!! #thatisall 5576
@Moniggyy People just like Obama cause he's black! #Racists #TeamRomney 5577
#debates Obama home run 5578
Anytime Obama talks about believing in America and Americans, I just don't believe it. 5579
#autograpgh Obama signing autograpghs like he is some rock star... give me a break. 5580
@LatinosMatter: #Obama MOPS THE FLOOR with #Mitt Romney!!!! Yes he did! 5581
Obama brought the grit tonight. I'm proud. 5582
Michelle Obama is one tall bitch! 5583
Very well played by Obama to save the 47% comments for last....great performance tonight, made me proud 5584
Obama won this! #handsdown 5585
What an intense, tension filled debate. Libya moment was deciding moment, Obama wins this one. Obama came to play tonight. #obama2012 5586
Bottom line, Romney did a great job tonight of reminding people of the failed Obama policies over the past 4 years. 5587
So Obama has a Morgan Freeman narrated commercial.  #itsover #hewins 5588
These people don't care, they just want pictures taken with Obama. 5589
Obama is doing the best he can for the mess of a country he got handed! #Obama2012 5590
Romney not even letting Obama talk 5591
@CadenHaynes because Obama is a beast. 5592
Obama Wins by a landslide! :) 5593
Exactly! RT"@CharlesMBlow: Obama saves "47%" for the last two minute so that Romney couldn't respond. #crafty #debate" 5594
Obama won this debate as soon at Romeny opened his mouth! 5595
Is it just me or did Obama's hair get whiter during the debate?...lol 5596
Of course Mr Obama waits to bring up 47% at the end when @MittRomney can't explain! Wow worried #potus? 5597
If Obama don't win this debate.......real Nigga shit......I'm gonna burn to house down. 5598
What's funny is, I think Mr. Romney did better this debate. Raising your voice and saying Obamacare a lot in first debate was not a victory. 5599
I'm pretty sure any president that took over after Bush would've had the same difficulties as Obama. Give him another four tears to fix it 5600
Obama verbally hit him with that uppercut. 5601
It was nice of Obama to show up for the debate this time. 5602
@Slate Obama won Romney got blitzed. Though I am voting for Obama I thought Romney won the first. 5603
Ig I'm the only one who doesn't like Obama. 5604
Thanks for showing up this time Obama, it's nice to have you back. #Obama2012 #forward 5605
Mitt and Obama are gonna go home and continued this debate on Skype 5606
Although romney didnt do as bad as obama in the 1st debate, I see it as 1-1 Obama won this round, next is boca raton. 5607

@ZainMotani Obama can free Boosie with a pardon at the end of his presidency. #wipemedown 5618
Mitt stuck his chin out and Obama punched it -Chris Matthews 5619
I hate that the reporters reporting after the debate are getting on President Obama! 5620
Obama took out the elite four with a metapod and no pokedex, they wouldn't even let Romney through the front door. 5621
What if Obama and Biden were able to tag team during the debate... 5622
He stuck his chin out and Obama punched him hard. #Obama2012 #debate 5623
#the debate is boring to watch after a while. I get tired of hearing Obama go ummm, ughhhh, and well actually... #anoying 5624
Amazing that Obama would seek to dodge Benghazi and Romney would let him. In the end, Obama said the buck stops with him. True statement... 5625
is Obama trying to debate about guns? he doesn't know a thing about guns and that's #fact 5626
@BenjaminWavey that sounded racist against my own race hahaha but I meant I'm team Obama. And yes! 5627
@gretawire I felt bad for Obama, he lost 2 debates .His record  looks bad. 5628
HA RT @SwinCash: #Welp President Obama hit em with the 47 percent like the UpperCut heard around the world.. Then drops the mic... *Tears* 5629
@Larrys_Bitch seeing as I'm canadian& don't know as much about america as you do, all I have to say is my family would be voting for Obama. 5630
@IChogan @Yo_Floyd Obama had more sense, less God. Simple fact. 5631
That debate was like Obama being the bus driver & Romney being that rude bitch. 5632
@papchuseyo Obama sucks... 5633
@BrettMineer: Obama needs to end on 47%! Just for fun! #hofdebate #Romney #Obama he did and very well too. 5634
Pres. Obama handled this debate much better than the first. 5635
Smart move by Obama waiting for the last word to directly address 47%. 5636
(President) - Barack Obama killed it tonight, lets do our parts and keep him in office if you truly support him #Obama2012 5637
Mane I'm in the process of trying to get rich...everybody PLEASE vote for Obama #SelfishTweet lol 5638
Obama won that debate easily.  As a woman Romney was so offensive. 5639
Mamas dont let your babies grow up to be Obama, let em pick guitars and drive them ol trucks cause cowboys have manners they don't interrupt 5640
I don't think Romney was as terrible as Obama was in the first debate. But it sure felt like he got whupped. 5641
this. RT @_FrenisWorld_: Ok Obama clearly won. Now go to Fox and they'll say Romney won and the moderator was wrong for interrupting Romney. 5642
Obama clearly won that debate 5643
Obama again speaks about four minutes longer than Romney. 5644
Obama shat on Romney. 5645
@CNBC2012 Moderator Candy Crowley is biased!!! You dont interupt Romney so Obama can speak. She shouldnt be allowed to vote!!!! 5646
Yes, it's hard to change a country in 4 years. But Obama knew that when he promised he would do it... And he didn't. 5647
I would say Obama killed it in that one!Obama and Biden: 2Romney and Ryan: 1 5648
Obama Won This Debate . 5649
#hofdebate all the hard work and sacrifice of the Hofstra community and Obama didn't even have the courtesy of acknowledging where he was! 5650
Obama got the trap niggas, hood niggas, twerkers, hoes, dope boys, & weed smokers watching the debate. Name one president who has done that? 5651
Wow Michelle Obama was just in Chapel Hill, now she's at the debate. #SheFlyin 5652
@GMA @ThisWeekABC @GStephanopoulos - I hope y'all won't miss and/or dodge the fact that (a) #Obama LIED and (b) Candy ran interference. 5653
@johncerisola The only reason teenagers like Obama is cause he's black and everyone thinks he's cool and like you just said a thug. Like no. 5654
Stfu. RT @realDonaldTrump: Such long rhetorical and boring answers from Obama. No wonder nothing gets done. 5655
@Evan_Sofa so is Obama but you don't see him bragging about it 5656
Obama won !!!  Send Romny back home 5657
when Obama can't answer a question, he has the moderator save him by changing the subject. 5658
Obama killed itttt. 5659
#debates Obama knows what is needed for this country. Romney is just gonna screw things up by putting his foot in his mouth! 5660
Obama delivered a.bis driver uppercut. Boom!! #debate 5661
Obama exceeded expectations, a low bar set by the last debate, yet he still loses. He's shared no vision for what he'd do w/ 4 more years. 5662

Final minute breakdown for debate: Pres Obama at 43:57, Romney at 40:58 minutes. 5665
Obama is the definition of #Clutch 5666
You fail to realize that Obama is not from the hood. In the hood, your life will suck no matter who the president is. 5667
I think the moment when Obama really showed he was serious was when the Libya subject came up. He took over with fire in his eyes 5668
It's amazing how Romney criticizes @BarackObama  for what he didn't do but his plans will take 5-8 years to see real change. #NOT BACKWARDS! 5669
Good win Obama!! Well won!! #Easy 5670
"Aggressiveness" is not in Obama's character so it seemed misplaced #butthatsjustmethough 5671
@DYANCASTILLEJO Obama, I feel his sincerity. 5672
Obama better give that black guy a hamburger, so he will vote for him again 5673
Obama once again murdered Romney in the Debate Tonight !! #Obama2012 5674
Our viewing party room thinks Obama won this debate. How about you? 5675
Approx Time period: Obama had 43:57. Romney had 40:48. Romney with the win! 5676
Libya issue seemed to be one of the most significant parts of debate... Interesting how Obama owned up to incident after Hillary's comments 5677
Ron Paul could blow both Obama and Romney out of the water in this debate. #nobandwagoner 5678
I really just don't like Obama 5679
Obama was on point. Engaged and strong. Mitt seemed arrogant. 5680
Wether some want to admit it or not, some people just are going to vote for Obama just because he is black. SOME not all 5681

@CallMeGrayy true, but the policies Obama has in place haven't worked and he plans to continue them 5686
@dannyajasso I don't know, the Libya question and getting fact-checked from Candy was a big moment to me like Obama's tone 2 wks ago. 5687
Obama should have dropped the mic after that final statement. He completely owned it !! 5688
Great moderation from Candy Crowley. Mitt seemed cranky and exasperated but President Obama was on point and intolerant of bullshit. #debate 5692
Sheesh RT @ColbyMarkel: Michelle Obama should give Colb that mouth 5693
Fuck you if your not voting for Obama!! 5695
Yeah. So i think Obama won this debate. 5696
Contentious, but one is telling the truth and the other is lying. Obama=liar. Romney=truth. 5697
I know y'all won't agree, but I don't care because I love my God. I really think Obama isn't following Him at all and that's the main reason 5698
Obama won that debate hands down. 5699
Obama ended with a knockout. The 47% comment = the bus driver uppercut! Dont try to explain, Mittens. Just get off the bus!! #POW! #fb 5700

Tonight Obama fought fire with fire but in his cool,  controlled way which makes it much more effective #debate 5734
Obama needed the moderator to bail him out and also called a man named Kerry "Kerr". lol 5735

#Obama won that one for sure. #Romney couldn't answer a question without going on the attack. Changed my opinion, Romney is disrespectful! 5754
Obama bothers me...please stop talking about how great he is. 5755
Obama for player the year 5756
Obama gots this! La raza is behind you! 5758
CNN not trying to let Obama be great 5759

Bottom line, Obama's policies have failed for 4 years &, if reelected, there is no reason to expect anything different over the next 4 years 5798
Thank you, President Obama. You speak for me. 5799
Obama needs a vacation. 5800
My take on debate: Obama did better than last debate, but not good enough. Romney held his own. Both had hits & misses, but Romney won. 5801

@jahollabackgirl Obama was being so rude! She was just doing her job! 5835
