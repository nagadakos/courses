<e>Obama</e> (and Candy) lied, our ambassador died:  No, Obama Didn’t Call Benghazi “Act of Terror” in Speech - http://t.co/qyIvnM19 481
Wanna hear a joke? Barack <e>Obama</e>. 482
Good Job <e>Obama</e> he really brought forth the issues and his plans to <a>fix them he was really tackling the real economic issues</a> #TeamBarack 483
How could you dislike a man like <e>Obama</e>? 484
Pretty clear victory for <e>Obama</e>. 485
Apparently <e>obama</e> has the healin powers of Christ #debates 486
<e>Obama</e> believes in self-reliance. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA 487
Who was it that denied enhanced security and why? #<e>Obama</e> <a>fails to answer<a>, but then he finally comes clean about what he knew at the time. 488
GREAT job President OBAMA!!! #vote4obama 489
@Barack<e>Obama</e> President Obama showed his strength tonight. A lot of factually facts were stated from the President. Great job!!!! 493
If you dont want to vote for <e>Obama</e> for other reasons, fine, but dont act like he could have supermanned the economy in four years 494
<e>Obama</e> kept saying "thats just not true"....What my president really wanted to say was "nigga thats some bull shit" 496
<e>Obama</e>didn't kill bin laden. One of my brother in arms did. He just happened to be president. <e>Obama</e> didn't find him soliders did 497
This was not just Obama doing what he had to do. This was <e>Obama</e> throwing down a double-pump slam dunk launched from 3 point land. #debate 498
<e>Obama</e><a> lied. Here's the fact check on his promised "changes" </a>as per 2008. http://t.co/bbmtFRZK #HofstraDebate #FightForJobs 499
<e>Obama</e> save the best for last. The 47 percent!!!! 500
Game, set and match to<e>Obama</e>. He got it; he fought back; he gave us all more than ample reason to carry on the fight.  http://t.co/jLboxf25 501
<e>Obama</e> was on his A GAME tonight, clear winner! #Obama2012 🇺🇸 503
<e>Obama</e> is just a terrorist... #justkidding #probablyisthough #killedambassador #seeyaobama ✌ 504
<e>Obama</e> saves "47%" for the last two minute so that<e> Romney </e>couldn't respond. #crafty #debate 505
AND if I hear ONE more person say "<e>Obama</e> killed Osama" I'm gonna lose my mind.. REAL heroes killed him, NOT <e>Obama</e>. Get your facts straight 506
Landslide victory for <e>Obama</e>. We saw one President for all Americans on that stage tonight, <e>Obama</e>. #Forward 507
President<e>Obama</e>struggled for weeks to offer a consistent story about the terrorist strike in Benghazi. #Debates #CantAfford4More 509
<e>Obama</e> Was Tyson In His Prime Tonight 511
<e>Obama</e> won--the whole thing, but especially the last question. #debate 513
<e>Obama</e> <a>doubles down on his cover up</a>. I love it. 515
It is panic time in Obamaville. Internals have to be showing <e>Romney </e>up 6-10. This is Reagan-Carter redux. #tcot #teaparty #p2 517
<e>Obama</e> needs to learn<a> how to speak about the question that is asked and to answer the question</a>. Not repeat shit that isnt needed. 519
<e>Obama</e> dominated that debate... 520
The fact that this debate will be recapped by Libya is not great for <e>Obama</e>. 521
<e>Obama</e> definitely secured the illegal immigrant vote. 523
<e>Obama</e> drones on and says nothing 525
<e>Obama</e> gave more guns to Mexican drug cartels than he did the consulate staff in Benghazi, so there's that. 527
Tonight <e>Barack</e> showed, as he has every day as president, that he’ll fight to ensure everyone has a fair shot at the American Dream. –mo 528
You can combine the speaking skills of Churchill, Reagan, and Lincoln, and President <e>Obama</e> could still not defend his own record. 529
Weird, <e>Obama</e> came across as bitter and clingy. #jerk 530
<e>Obama</e> would be more convincing if he weren't the incumbent. He keeps talking like he just started last month. 531
<e>Obama</e> says "I'm gonna do this this and this" but why hasn't he done it yet? What happened to doing that these past 4 years? #stepup #Debates 532
My take on <e>Obama</e> tonight: "There is <a>nothing worse than aggressive stupidity</a>."- von Goethe 533
Big, Angry<e>Obama</e> just came off as <a>unnatural, uneasy and uncomfortable</a>. I think it made him look sour and mean. #debates 534
Maybe I missed it, but did President<e>Obama</e> go another full debate without outlining his plan for next four years? #debate 537
President <e>Obama</e> 100% - Very, very obvious.  "Binders of women"? - I don't think so! 538
We're a little off-topic, here. --<e>Obama</e> when he got caught with Chinese investments. 539
So the government doesn't create jobs, but it's <e>Obama</e>'s <a>fault</a> for not creating jobs? 540
If you can not beat them, then<a> lie</a> lie lie to the American people and hope they are to stupid to fact check and care. #<e>Obama</e> 541
Me voting for <e>Obama</e> would be like me running my head into a wall, over and over and over and over! 542
I find it revealing few people even comment on, much less get troubled by, <e>Obama</e> talking about "<a>hunting people down</a>" like he's a T-1000 543
I really would like to tweet my opinion on the debate tonight but I don't think I could fit it into 140 characters how ridiculous <e>Obama</e> is. 544
If <e>Obama</e> is here... who's running hell? #SHFL 546
<e>Obama</e>killed it tonight. Absolutely killed it. If i believed any of it I would vote for him. But such an improvement. 547
★ President<e>Obama</e> is <a>controlling this debate completely</a>. This is remarkable to be seeing this. #nbcpolitics #History ★ 548
<e>Obama</e>promised so much last time and didn't do anything so Im confused as to why everyone believes him this time. 550
<e>Obama</e> put more border patrol agents on border.... then gave Mexican drug cartels guns to shoot them with. 551
<e>Obama</e> is what we need for a <a>steady, permanent improvement in our country</a>. Y'all already know who I'll be voting for. #fuckmitt #Obama2012 552
Let's be clear: <e>Obama</e>is no <a>great friend to immigrants and brown people </a>around the world. #debate 555
Our <a>economy has raised 17% in the last four years</a>,<e>Obama</e> made something out of nothing 556
I truthfully can't stand listening to <e>Obama</e>.. He hasn't done anything to get us out of debt so why the heck  would you vote for him 557
<e>Obama</e> got more<a> immigrants out of here </a>than any other president. 558
If <e>Obama</e>were an ice-cream flavor, it would probably taste like bad decisions.🍦😂 559
My mom was a single mom <e>Obama</e> that doesn't make you a female in the workplace 560
Eeeewwww <e>Obama</e>'s fingers are so long... 561
I think <e>Obama</e> has a blinking problem. #presidentialdebate2012 562
<e>Obama</e> is by far the better choice, I honestly believe both of them aren't all that great but we're better off with<e>Obama</e> 563
<e>Obama</e> should pay attention.  Had to ask name again.  Really? 565
<e>Obama</e>stop taking bin ladins credit. The cia and bush admin has been working on it for years and all you do is say "shoot him" @FoxNews 566
Yes <e>Obama</e> you have done everything that you can...WHICH HAS BEEN NOTHING!!! 567
<e>Obama</e> is LITERALLY choking!! 568
<e>Obama</e> deported my grandma 569
Never thought I'd say this but I really hope <e>Obama</e> gets reelected 571
I'm a firm believer of<e>Obama</e>'s slogan. We need to CHANGE the current president. 572
Q. How can<e>Obama</e> improve the economy? A. Lose the election. 573
<e>Obama</e> dropped the ball on the Benghazi attack. Fact 574
<e>Obama</e><a> did awesome tonight</a>! I live my president! Great job! #obamabiden2012 four more years! ❤💙☺ 575
President<e>Obama</e> im proud of you :) you are more fit to run this country and me and my family are supporting you 100 percent! @BarackObama 576
President <e>Obama</e> brought it home  #fourmoreyears 581
<e>Obama</e> really wants us to have an education :) 582
<e>Obama</e> won this one on style, substance, facts and character! 584
This is My President. Mr. President <e>Obama</e>. This is the man that has done all he can to get this country back on track. Let's give him 4 more 585
<e>Obama</e> you had four years and shit has not changed like it was said to. So therefor you don't deserve another four. 586
<e>Obama</e> Cant run on his record due to the fact of<a> all the failures</a> 589
Wow... Is Everyone really going to be fooled by <e>Obama</e> again?? What good has he done for us in the last 4 years.. 590
Meanwhile <e>Obama</e>sounded very confident telling a bunch of <a>bald-faced lies</a>. #debate 591
When<e>Obama</e><a> didn't say anything about God</a>, that really bothered me... 593
SherriEShepherd loved that President<e>Obama</e> ended with the 47% comment. Very effective. 594
first,<e>Obama</e>- I hate to tell you this, but you had nothing to do with killing Osama Bin Laden! 595
<e>Obama</e> takes way to much credit for killing Osama Bin Laden. I'm pretty sure that was the navy seals. 596
Not even close. A complete reversal from the first debate, <e>Obama</e> winning on every level.<a> Audience connection, emotional appeals, facts</a>. 597
Did <e>Obama</e> even do anything his last term that actually benefited America sufficiently? 598

The major difference in this debate: <e>Obama</e> is elaborating on <a>his plans</a>, whether they are put into action in the future or not 1850
<e>Obama</e> wants us to <a>create</a> the next Apple. Like. A pear I figure. 1851
From shovel ready to high wage high skill? You couldn't do shovel ready <e>Obama</e>, how are YOU gonna go high wage high skill? #lnyhbt #Debate 1852

I still laugh at the fact that <e>Obama</e> referred to a "child" as a 21 year old the last<a> debate</a>. 1872
Set the <a>people<a> straight <e>Obama</e>! 1875
<e>Obama</e> claims <a>"low skill" jobs</a> belong overseasâ€¦shows his real lack of concern as it regards having ALL Americans being able to<a> WORK</a> 1876
<e>Obama</e> should say I want <a>world peace</a> and drop the mic! 1877
@jaronjones That exchange was a complete embarrassment for <e>Obama</e>.  He had nothing to say in his defense. 1878
<e>Obama</e> literally just said some jobs aren't coming back and that he doesn't want <a>low-skill jobs</a>. High-skilled industry can't <a>employ </a>everyone. 1879

I'm telling you <e>Obama</e> is <a>illuminate</a> 1907
cannot believe <e>Obama</e> just brought up the <a>47%</a> thing. 1909
Given how many people think <e>Obama</e> is a communist/socialist, him saying that the <a> free market</a> is great IS countering a misconception. 1910
So awkward seeing Duran argue with James about <e>Obama</e> on fb right now.. LOL 1911
<e> <e>Obama</e></e> just said he believes in <a>self-reliance</a>. That's 100% against all of his <a>policies</a>. He wants people to rely on the<a> government</a>. 1912

No doubt that <e>Obama</e> talks a better game. But the  both suck. The whole <a>system</a> sucks. Can I vote for a<a> new government</a>? 1926
I'm I the only one that sees similarities between <e>Obama</e> and @TheRock ? 1927
This final <e>Obama</e> hit on the <a>47 percent comment</a> is his best punch so far. Strong finish for <e>Obama</e>. #debates 1928
Awesome <a>closing remarks </a>for Pres. <e>Obama</e> 1930
@TheLastWord @Barack<e>Obama</e>  I wish President <e>Obama</e> would have brought up the fact that the Republicans want to get rid of <a>minimum wage</a>. 1931

<e>Obama</e> came out guns blazing! I believe he won this <a>debate</a>. 1948
Absolutely... RT @foreveryagirl I think #<e>Obama</e> did a much better job in this <a>debate</a> vs the last one #<e>Obama</e>2012 1950
#<e>Obama</e> saves the best for last. Brings up <a>47% remark</a> at the end of the <a>debate</a>. Last thing everyone hears. He slams #MittTheTwit! #debate2012 1952
Yeah <e>Obama</e> never called it a terrorist attack in the rose garden. Called it an "attack" that's pretty broad Barack 1953

@SuzBrockmann I feel like that was just a game of Mortal Kombat, and when <e>Obama</e> said 47% the words "finish him" came on my screen. 1962
<a>Close debate</a>, but I think <e>Obama</e> took it. 1965
This was a great <a>debate</a>! Good job <e>Obama</e>! 1967
Now that's the assertiveness I <a>want to see</a> from President <e>Obama</e>. 1969
President #<e>Obama</e> was better, he was more specific, confident. MSNBC it might be easily considered <e>Obama</e>'s best <a>debate</a> performance. 1970
Hempstead brought out the aggression in <e>Obama</e> 1971
Clear <a>victory</a> for President <e>Obama</e> 1973
Number one reason I hate <e>Obama</e>? Because <a>killing</a> a child should never be legal, even if you consider it just a 'group of cells'. 1974

Just because I don't vote for <e>Obama</e> doesn't make me<a> racist</a>. The fact that you vote for him because he's black kinda does. 1994

<e>Obama</e> or <a>civil war</a> 2216
Read the transcript. RNC chair accuses <e>Obama</e> of lying about Libya and moderator "aided and abetted." 2217
So why does <e>Obama</e> get props for bin laden, but doesn't get held responsible for <a>unemployment</a>, he inherited both, be fair I'm that 2218
That was fun!! I wish I had some snacks tho. Vodka flowing and fearing for the morning. <e>Obama</e> is back, Spain is in the clear, Greece is TOST 2223
As I predicted <a>Democrats</a> would say <e>Obama</e> won overwhelmingly. I am shocked Democrats would say their candidate won. 2225

@neaboo89 the problems <e>Obama</e> didn't create 2232
<e>Obama</e> has appeared weak and tired in several recent public forums. I wonder if he actually even wants to be president anymore... 2234
<e>Obama</e> <a>talked</a> louder, but didn't tell us what he would differently than he is already doing. Talked a lot,but said nothing. An empty suit. 2235
It's funny how these retired senators that are republicans are<a> endorsing</a> <e>Obama</e> 2236
I only wish <e>Obama</e> would have shown this vigor during the last <a>debate</a>! #Debate2012 2237
<e>Obama</e> keeps my hope alive in good men. 2239
Binder-women & "My pension is not as large as yours" will be the 2 memorable quotes from tonight's #<a>debate</a>. It's a draw edging toward <e>Obama</e>. 2240

MSM is basically saying that <e>Obama</e> won this one because he wasn't as lousy as he was last time. 2282
Remember when <e>Obama</e> said 4 years ago that he was gonna cut <a>national debt</a> in half? That's funny because its almost doubled #idiot 2283
80% say <e>Obama</e> won #kewl 2285

Man I hope <e>Obama</e> win though.. 2291
People need to understand the <a>US Government's</a> process before they bash <e>Obama</e>. Things that haven't been achieved are not from lack of effort 2292

 Finished watching the entire debate. <e>Obama</e> won hands down. 3135
 @WheresMyLiberty that doesn't even make sense. I'm not supporting <e>Obama</e>. I'm supporting someone who actually has a shot at beating him. 3136
 I don't even have commentary for this debate because President <e>Obama</e> <a>executed and dominated</a> 3137
 I'm gonna laugh when <e>Obama</e> wins and the country will be in the worst state ever and I'm gonna just laugh in your retarded faces. 3138

 #Obama #Romney  Lies spoken in an articulate manner are still lies. This is a <e>Obama's</e> way.  He stood on the debate stage and lied..Fire him 3177
 @Talkmaster If Romney had to describe how different he is from W, shouldn't <e>Obama</e> '12 have to show how he's different from the last 4 yrs? 3178

 Both <e>Romney and Obama</e> have really annoying speaking voices  3191
 The worlds gonna be one fucked up place if <e>Obama</e> takes presidency again #realtalk 3193
 Based on what I heard <e>Obama</e> say last night, if he gets re-elected, I am tempted to give up-close my business and unemploy 230+ folks! 3194
 @realDonaldTrump <e>Obama</e> was more of a boistrous bull spouting out the same old things that he DIDN'T achieve in 4 years and can't in 4 more. 3196
 @PaulRyanVP Ask America why the press has never ask <e>Obama</e> the tough questions these last 4 years. 3197
 @MeKaymi_Tensei He carried himself poorly in that <a>debate</a>, but I do think the shitty moderator gave <e>Obama</e> an advantage he didn't need. 3199
 @uhlyssaoliviero - if <e>Obama</e> gets elected, guys like me will go out of business. People who pay the taxes that enable fin aid, will be gone 3200
 I bet <e>Obama</e> was the kid in class who could smooth talk his teachers into postpone homework...but never actually turned it in 3201
 <e>Obama</e> has connections with Al queda terrorist organization. 3202

 Here bit by bit the American people are standing up to Socialisim,Communisim,Marxist Muslims and <e>Obama</e> the Black Master of Black the people. 3209
 Oh yeah. I love getting yelled about <e>Obama</e> at 9 in the morning #grandmaprobs 3214
 If you read today's news headlines, you'd think <e>Obama and Romney</e> were in a UFC cage match instead of using mildly heated rhetoric. 3216
 @TheTimmyTebow  Try to find something good to say about somebody if u can but lv <e>Obama</e> alone. It's not flattering to u. 3217
 I don't appreciate how <e>Obama</e> <a>capitalisizes</a> on the fact that he's black. 3218
 @BillPhill12 Omg, that was the funniest thing ever - and every person struggling in <e>Obama's</e> <a>economy</a> wanted to say it, too. 3219
 AllI can say about last night's debate is that <e>Obama</e> looked pretty desperate. 3220
 <e>Obama</e> called <e>Romney</e> an Azzhole!  #Funny 3221
 The amount of <e>Obama</e> <a>impressions</a> I hear is sickening. 3222
 But honestly, My opinion is neutral this year, and that's why I'm not even voting. Both <e>Mitt and Obama</e> are f'n shit up. Why bother... #meh 3223
 Shit that was a low blow to <e>Obama</e> omg lol 3226

 @TheValorieClark i don't like either one. I am more socially conservative. But <e>Obama</e> hasn't done enough good in his <a>first four years</a>. 3232
 I'm going to put an <e>#Obama & #Romney</e> sticker on my car to confuse people. The good news is that I don't particularly like either of them... 3235
 @MichelleObama  awesome we really need <e>Mr. Obama</e> to win! 3236
 It's amazing looking at my twitter and Facebook feeds and seeing how republican my friends are. I was a miracle <e>Obama</e> even got in office. 3237
 Someone had a sticker on they car that said defeat <e>Obama</e>. Everybody should get out they car to whoop they ass 3238

 President <e>Obama</e> doesn't even answer a ligit <a>question about the Libya situation</a> ...or didn't want 2. Families of the deceased want answers. 3241
 I really don't like bringing politics on social networks but despite my confusion I think I might go with <e>Obama</e> ... 3242
 .@SpoonerSpot Exactly. <e>Obama & Romney</e> are too well-rehearsed with stats that make voters' eyes glaze over. #debate 3246
 @seanhannity Did you notice <e>Obama's</e> demeanor and voice when Romney smacked him about Libya, he was pissed. 3247
<e>Obama</e> nailed it! #ObamaAtOU #fourmoreyears 3252
 <e>Obama</e> made the case for his 2nd term.  He showed the country his values and beliefs. 3253

 I tried to find a binder of women for $20 or less on Ebay. After coming up short, I decided to donate the $20 to <e>Obama's</e> campaign instead... 3260
 Who better to deceive the people than they own kind ... I really think <e>Obama</e> a puppet 3261

 @ewilliam_ <e>Obama</e> record on what he promised and failed to do hurts him 3278
 One thing is clear…<e>Obama</e> legitimately does not like <e>Romney</e> as a person. He finds Mitt's success contemptible. #debates 3280
 @KimPinkx3 <e>Obama</e> is a huge supporter of community college 3283
 Idgaf if <e>Obama</e> is black, that's NOT a reason why we are voting for him! He's just amazing all around 3284

 I honestly don't want <e>Obama or Romney</e> to win. 3293
 Don't expect me to defend <e>Obama's</e> policies & broken promises. Like I said, blind political allegiance is funny. "@a_tweet_life @Al_Gorelioni 3295
 I think <e>Obama</e> is secretly a terrorist. His <a>name</a> scares me. "Barack Obama" come on son'! 3296

 Everyone Is Entitled To Their Own Opinions.. But I'm Proud To Say That I'm Voting For <e>Obama</e>. #thatisall 3300
 I've seen 3 Presidents look at and lie to the American people. Nixon, Clinton, now <e>Obama</e>. Obama's lie involved the death of four people. 3301
 This quote is for everyone who voted for <e>Obama</e> in 2008. "Fool me once shame on you. Fool me twice shame on me." #Romney2012 3302
 President <e>Obama</e> lied to the American population tonight. Dug a whole new hole for him on this Lybia thing. #Debates 3303
 Ed Gillespie: "For every <a>job</a> <e>Obama</e> admin created, 6 people left the workforce".  #debates 3305
 "99% of <e>Obama's</e> policies didn't work. Just like the people that voted for him." 3307
 <e>Obama</e>-Thanks for <a>answering questions in the first minute of your turn</a> instead of walking around them..... #abcpolitics 3308
 <e>Obama</e> shut up your a liar. <e>Romney</e> shut up your a liar. 3309
 Polls say <e>Obama</e> 46% vs <e>Romney</e> 39%. #debates 3312
 Even in 2008, <e>Obama</e> didnt statistically show he was a good enough candidate for Dew. 3314
 @aegies @BarackObama If i had the money and wasn't so broke because of college, i'd top that with $200. <e>Obama's</e> got my full support and vote 3315
 @itsKirenbitch <e>Obama</e> is classy as fuck. I wish I was American so I could vote for him. 3316
 I love how <e>Obama</e> <a>brought in the hiring of teachers into the AK47 question</a>. WTF? For the record hiring more gov doesn't grow the economy. 3317
 THIS WILL GET YO ASS BEAT"@5hannnnnon: <e>Obama</e> shut up you nigger. You're a liar.Your brother lives in Kenya where you were born. #Romney2012" 3320
 @DavidLimbaugh <e>Obama</e> not as compelling a liar as Clinton was. Not to mention media monopoly is not the same. 3321
 @akinfolaju how do u do... Didn't watch it but using wat I have read so far it was a good nite for <e>Obama</e> 3322
 "I know people that have <a>healthcare</a> because of <e>Obama</e>." ... "I know people that have <a>jobs</a> because of Obama." (via @jferg & @benjaminkelley) 3324
 <e>Obama</e> totally ignored nor really <a>nswered questions on Benghazi or "Fast & Furious"</a>!  And MSM says he "won"? LOL 3326
 <e>Obama</e> wins the 2nd debate! (Once the conservative commentators go for the moderator you know their candidate lost) 3327
 <e>#Obama</e> is the truth. 3333
 @AlexisClewis24 and like I said I dot care who president is.. But <e>Obama</e> sure as hell didnt do a good job fixing ANYTHING 3334
 @AshleyOkinawa lld I didn't say anything to harm their party, <e>Romney</e> did that for himself.I just commented on <e>Obama</e>! 3336
 @gaylortangg and <e>Obama</e> has strikingly similar ideologies to Jimmy Carter and Karl Marx, both of whom know nothing of successful nations. 3338
 <e>Obama</e> did not answer the question on Libya. <e>Romney</e> missed the opportunity to demand an answer n the moderator didnt demand an answer either! 3339
 "@coledixon15: <e>Obama</e> is a self centered jackass that needs to take his foreign ass back to his Muslim countries." @llcoollittle & this guy 2 3340
 @RNCResearch Heck it wasn't the lies that are the problem, it was the lack of <a>ideas</a> from <e>Obama</e>, so another four years of the same. 3342
 The Republican goal is not to beat <e>Obama</e> down. It's to shake down and beat down the American people. Keep your heads up. Obama 2012. 3343
 If I have to listen to one more <e>Obama</e> <a>speech</a>, I think I will end up in a loony bin. What a grating voice. 3344
 If <e>Obama</e> wasn't running for president would you still be excited about politics? 3345
 From assault rifles to education, <e>Obama</e> you are OWNING this <a>debate</a>. Brilliant public speaker, just fucking brilliant. 3346
 I am so pumped up right now. I cannot even sleep. #TeamObama - tonight we saw why we are going to do everything we can to reelect <e>#Obama</e> 3347
 Bringing manufacturing back question: <e>Romney</e> - China is a cheat and a thief. #yellowperilObama - invest in advance manufacturing, R&D, tech 3348
 Will <e>@BarackObama</e> EVER correct <e>Romney</e>? The vast majority of that deficit is Bush's--particularly his 2 wars Obama finally put on the books! 3349
 Listen <e>Obama</e>, Wallstreet and the big car companies you bailed out are in the same league. Quit blaming other people for your problems. 3351
 Finally just watched the debate on DVR.  Heated and what I have been waiting for, <e>Obama</e> was on the defensive for most of it. 3352
 I will admit, #Bush's spending was out of control. But <e>Obama's</e> <a>spending habits</a>... just completely unacceptable #NotFittoGovern #Debate2012 3354
 <e>Obama</e> you got Morgan Freeman to be spokesman on one of your commercials? Well since you got God to speak highly of you, you will win. 3355
 <e>Obama</e> did <a>lower taxes</a> on middle class. No Job, No Money, Lower Taxes #lnyhbt 3356
 @lindaph1 Hell <e>Obama</e> can't even take care of one border patrol agent how can he handle <e>diplomatic security</e>? BHO Admin. is a chinese cluster. 3357
 <e>Barack Obama</e> wins the debate. Bristol Palin voted off Dancing With The Stars. It's a great night to be a liberal in America! 3359
 Election news, CNN calls it for <e>Obama</e>. FOX News calls it for <e>Romney</e>. Adult Swim calls it a clear victory for Meatwad. 3365
 Today's Presidential Debate ws OK. For me, <e>#Obama</e> is a winner today by an Inch, jst 1 inch. He shud b more Charged up in d nxt &last rd. 3366
 <e>Obama</e> whooped both Romney and the moderator! Dayummmm #Obama2012 3368
 Taliban shot #Malala for her ideal was #Obama, All female fans of Brad Pitt, Justin Bieber etc should be careful in Pakistan 3369
 Wondering how <e>polls</e> can say Obama won the debate but <e>Romney</e> won on issues.  It's hard to understand polling at times! #perception #debate 3370
 <e>Obama's</e> <a>voice</a> is so assuring. 3372
 Heard <e>Obama</e> used Biden's acting coach - who evidently specializes in LYING & goofy looking fake aggression with angry eyes! 3374
 @KevinMcGil Whoooooooooaaa, Nellie! :-) RT FOX News poll has <e>Obama</e> winning tonight's #debate by 70%. @barackobama @davidaxelrod @joenbc 3376
 Oi why are Americans so ignorant? I think <e>Obama</e> is better than any other past president 3378
 Only watched enough of the debate to form an intitial impression, basically <e>Obama</e> <a>walked</a> in like a pimp and ate that face. 3379
 Wait for the foreign policy debate.@stretch4444 I wish <e>Romney</e> had brought up the multitude of daily briefings missed by <e>Obama</e> ! 3380
 Michelle <e>#Obama</e> broke debate rules by cheering when moderator lied about #Libya to save Barack's butt. #MSMBias 3384
 @ItsEmaxSnitches Who will win, <e>Obama or Romney</e>? click @VotetoWin_2012 and follow the link in her description! 3385
 The <e>#Obama</e> legacy:  Bad Policies = Poor Results = Gloomy Future. Would you really rehire him to make sure this happens?#Romney 3387
 Students have been camping out all night to see <e>Obama</e> and more students are beginning to line up! 3388
 I'm not racist but <e>Obama</e> needs to remember that a white man built this land. A black man sold his families to the white man. 3389
 @AidanLicks but if you want government to have less power, <e>Obama</e> should be your biggest enemy 3390
 <e>Mr. President</e> please stop the cover up. You did not call it a terrorist attack until 2 weeks after the attack. We have the transcript @Obama 3391
 @GMA who wrote this? Badly worded question. <e>Obama</e> won. 3392
 Interesting, too, that President <e>Obama</e> called Mitty on his "Social Ideas"-- BECAUSE  SOCIAL = PEOPLE and NOT CORPORATIONS ! 3393
 <e>Obama</e> calls out on Romney about his investment on companies (Bain Capital) outsourcing American jobs to China (Sensata plant in Illinois)... 3394
 #debate Rose garden presidential statement (3:53 mark) <e>Obama</e> says "All Americans always.." clearly not talking specifically of <a>Benghazi</a> 3395
 @keder False statemen. Obama had 14, Mitt Romney had 2, Crowley had 1. <e>Obama</e> wins on falsehoods #debate2012 3396
 @jay33231 just listening to <e>Obama</e> <a>talk</a> and blatantly <a>lie</a> is enough to make me want to vomit over and over again 3397
 White folks treasure being considered an honorary member of an oppressed people. A Republican coworker voted <e>Obama</e> to keep his hood card. 3398
 Best thing about the debate? If <e>Obama</e> thinks he won the first, he'll have a similarly distorted impression of the second. 3399
 Yes, <e>Barack Obama</e> LIED last night. On September 12 he was blaming a video, not terrorism, for Libya. LIED. #mapoli 3400
 EVERY American knows lots of people who are out of work since <e>Obama</e> was elected. THAT will get him fired! 3401
 If <e>Obama</e> wins this election because of women's issues...I lose faith in my gender. #prolife #smallgovernment #RomneyRyan12 3402
 Obama26Obama Let's hope WHEN <e>Obama</e> is overturned, he ends up on welfare and food stamps. ) 3404
 Why is the media is claiming a win for <e>Obama</e>? Actually being awake this debate doesn't count. I like him even less, he acted like a jerk. 3405
 <e>Obama</e> SHOULDN'T have to keep reassuring his base after last night. Please let him speak2&secure the independent& undecideds w/out criticism 3406
 #debate If <e>Obama</e> had been telling the truth last night, he might have won.  America loses when a President lies to our face! #RomneyRyan 3407
 For a man with 4 years on the job, pres <e>Obama</e> seems to be very uncertain and lacking of conviction. 3408
 Great debate for <e>Obama</e> last night I gotta say title of one of my newest song is what went down and that is (I Don't Run From Nobody) 3409
 @GayPatriot <e>Obama</e> is answering questions from US Weekly followers today. Let's overwhelm him with tough questions! 3410
 Final proof <e>Obama</e> won the debate, #FoxNews is "raising questions" about  Candy Crowley as moderator. #p2 #topprog #tcot 3411
 truth-<e>Obama</e> failed on emigration reform,but the republicans did to-they never gave any help even when they got what they wanted. 3412
 Why did <e>Romney</e> say unemployment rates have gone up since <e>Obama</e> took office? Wasn't there that study last week that said they'd gone down? 3413
 According to him, I'm what's wrong with society because I think comparing <e>Obama</e> to Hitler is disgusting and makes no sense. 3414
 <e>President Obama</e> is worth 12million and has money over in china 3415
 .@AndrewRugg Predictably, <e>the NYTimes and CNN</e> have declared <e>Obama</e> the winner and those are the MSM headlines. 3416
 <e>Obama</e> lied about <a>Libya and production of coal</a>.  Obama claimed he has signed more permits  for coal. Not true, People in WV are unemployed 3419
 @whoisdemichael actually, when <e>Obama</e> was a senator, he proposed the bills & approved the plans that are responsible for our nation's debt. 3420
 @Daggy1 <e>Obama</e> didn't. Went straight into education. High end jobs. Prob there is. High end = low volume. We got that now in Ireland. 3421
 @DETECTIVE4LIFE @davidwebbshow yes, <e>#Obama</e> had rage in him, felt bad for man in audience who asked question. Out of control n too defensive 3422
 Don't live in America so it doesn't concern me but I want to see <e>Obama</e> lose just to see what Romney can do in 4 years 3423
 @SydneyREDtaylor I don't think either of them are talking about taking away financial aid but I do think <e>Obama</e> has helped with that a lot. 3424
 They just said "Obama has really been pounding hard" on the news, do they even listen to themselves when they talk? haha 3425
 @Semkae I guess u didn't read the links I sent u. Even conservatives like Krauthammer and Laura Ingraham said <e>Obama</e> won @omarilyas @chiume 3428
 <e>Obama</e> is gonna outsource low paying jobs (most of y'all) Create more High skilled jobs. (NONE of y'all) 3431
 <e>Obama</e> hits back in fiery debate: A more aggressive Barack Obama buries the memory of a poor first showing as he and challenger Mitt R... 3432
 <e>Obama's #failingagenda</e> is burying the middle class and hurting families! RT if you agree and read more from AFP Prez @TimPhillipsAFP!! 3434
 <e>Obama</e> cannot run on his record and 4 more years would be a repeat of 1st 4 years @DishFeed 3435
 All of the Obama supporters keep asking for specifics of Romney's plan. I'm just asking for Obama to present any bit of a plan. 3438
 @brad4rdr  <e>Fox News</e> says Romney won. Given their record of accuracy, we can be confident that Obama did. 3439
 Yes <e>Obama</e> is DESTROYING the MYTH of White genetic & intellectual Superiority and? @jawbreakerctc01 @REM63489 @bootyisyou @BarackObama TKCAL 3441
 Well just found out <e>Obama</e> used to be a pot head #blowingupintheovaloffice 3442

 FTD is irking the hell outta me. Buy flowers ONCE, and they parked their asses in my inbox like <e>Obama</e>. 3444
 "@WSJ: According to polls of undecided voters, <e>Barack Obama</e> narrowly won last night's presidential #debate." A narrow win is still a win! 3447
 <e>President Obama's</e> <a>little trips to Virginia</a> are really cramping my flight plans. 3448
 @TheSlimmyMan @evalongoria How did <e>Obama</e> win! Please explain. He didn't answer a single question he was asked? 3449
 @emilyctamkin You'll never see them post something like, "Well Hugo Chavez endorsed Obama, so LOOK AT WHAT <e>OBAMA'S</e> VOTING BASE REPRESENTS." 3450
 Ultimate irony!!! @Chris_Moody <e>Obama</e> to crowd in Iowa: "I certainly don't think politicians should control the health care that you get." 3451
 <e>Obama</e> is losing the election based on his last 4 years of lack luster performance. He has a history now. VOTE #mitt2012 lets get jobs moving 3452
 "I consider it a part of my responsibility as president of the United States to fight against negative stereotypes of Islam." - Barack Obama 3453

 I will soon. Just sat down for the 2016 <e>Obama's</e> America movie. 3455
 Romney doesn't have a five point plan, he has a one point plan - <e>Obama</e> ...That's right call his bullshit!  3456
 @ChicGrl427 @RepubGrlProbs I don't think <e>Obama</e> won, but I see your point. 3459
 Biden on debate last night: <e>Obama</e> showed himself as "a man of principle, a man of  gumption, with a steady hand and a clear vision." 3461
 <e>Romney's</e> history of hiring women from his binders is noteworthy, <e>Obama's</e> history of hiring from welfare list not so much.  Your choice. 3462
 & Yessss <e>Obama</e> won last night debate :) 3463
 @americasvoice  are Latinos Libs fucking insane?It's <e>Obama</e> policies which have resulted in record deportations&S-Comm of millions Mexicanos! 3465

 Everybody taking about i love Obama,i love Romney and I'm like,I LOVE WEED!! 3469
 I hope BravoTV hosts a Real Presidents Reunion series with Romney and Obama after the election #debate 3470
 <e>Obama</e> doing a wonderful job. 3471
 <a>"Governor Romney you don't have a 5 point plan, you have a 1 point plan"</a> <e>@BarackObama</e> that was a good one. #Debates 3472
 @JoeBiden <e>Obama</e> won the debate by a landslide 3473
 @KeithMcCullough @daytrend  IF <e>Obama</e> won, it was with the help of the moderator. I call that cheating. 3474

 @washingtonpost have you dummies still not realized, as CNN has already said, that mitt Romney did not misstep. <e>@BarackObama</e> lied again 3477
 I'm voting for <e>Obama</e>. Even thought he did not fulfill all othe promises due to tough making decions he still helped us in some serious ways. 3479
 <e>Obama</e> have Teenagers watching the "Presidential Debate " ! He's the first President to do that! That's what you call  making CHANGES ! 3480
 And <e>Obama</e> is the savior who is going to bring world peace to the world. 3481
 @hardball James #Lipton to Chris #Matthews:America has a choice--does she want a president or a boss...and I mean a boss. <e>#Obama #Romney</e> 3482
 @EvaLongoria @NathanFillion you got to be kidding... <e>Obama</e> lies-When his lips are moving.  Should be tried for treason, impeached and jailed 3483
 Obama: you want some votes?  Legalize weed. Free boosie. Before Romney do it. 3484
 @JeffersonObama Well <e>Obama</e> is doomed bcz he will lose TX, AL and MS :( lol 3485

 My aunty said she votin fa Mitt Romney , caus <e>Obama</e> be smoking too much caus his lips blk... Lmmfao ! 3487
 I find it very interesting that <e>Obama</e> criticizes Romney for having a large pension. I guess he thinks success is bad. That's the Obama way. 3488
 When they were talking about immigration, <e>Romney</e> called them "illegal." <e>Obama</e> called them "undocumented." It's the little things. 3492
 Key difference between <e>Romney & President Obama</e> is Romney talks about WHAT he's going to do while Obama talks about HOW he's going to do it. 3493
 I guess everybody i follow is voting for <e>Obama</e>,  cus everybody bad mouthing Romney lol 3494
 Too many people on the Obama bandwagon solely because he's black. 3495
 @Trollpecki I thought this was Romney v Obama, not Romney v Candy and Barry 3497
 Whats the Difference...between <e>Obama</e> and a Monkey..?The Monkey has smaller ears.LOOOOOOOOOOL.Nah I kid. But forreal..tho Fuck Politics. 3500
 Hey <e>Obama</e>! you export <a>inflation</a> to the world you dick! #YouHaveNoBrain 3502
 <e>Obama</e> wants to lower corporate tax rate? News to me... #debate 3503
 I believe the <e>moderator</e> is slightly favoring Obama #ohwell #notmad #heisthepresident 3504
 <e>Obama</e> questions Romney's commitment to women's health care, pointing to the Republican's vow to eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood. 3505
 @Jadore_Elidja @santi_41 Mr.pena I think you should go for <e>Obama</e> now. (Not that I'm anyone to say but after that, just sayin) 3506
 If you or ya folks ain't rich, and you got loans, yo ass need to be tryna vote for <e>Obama</e> 2 or 3 times! lol #SallieMaeAintNoHoe lmaoo 3507
 Is it bad that one of the reasons that I like <e>Obama</e> (in a politically unbiased way) is that he wears nice <a>suits</a>? #shallow 3510
 <e>Romney</e> great answer on foreign competition, <e>Obama</e>-there you go again, give me 4 more years & I'll do better next time, trust me 3511
 <e>Obama</e> only makes sense 3514
 To make this debate more interesting Obama just needs to start rapping  #justsaying 3515
 @ilaffalot Nah I think <e>Romney's</e> gunna throw a punch at <e>Obama</e>. It's getting heated! 3516
 Seriously... <e>Obama</e> is not going to bring up the 47 percent remark? 3517
 Just heard my dad say "Obama shut up"  hahaha. How bout we say fuck both these old dudes. Vote for real freedom#SamRussellForPresident 3518
 @TrIzZySpaCedOuT and if you were actually interested I would ask you to tell me the bad things Obama has done as president. 3519
 I think the only people stupid enough to vote for <e>Obama</e> again are the ones who can vote for the first time this year #smfh #getout #NObama12 3520
 Romney is getting drowned out by both Obama and Crowley! #debate 3522
 Ahaha did that mediator lady really just back up Obama and shit on Romney?! At a girl! 3523
 I wish I could just hug <e>President Obama</e> and tell him every little thing will be okay. 3526
 <e>Obama</e> is good if he got the tennage community watching this debate 3527
 No doubt #Obama has gotten more time to talk. Yet if #Romney goes over by a few seconds, the President gripes to #Candy. #Debate 3528
 Some black people our age may or may not vote for Obama, but MOST older black people out of school, working, or retired will vote for him. 3529
 According to <e>Obama</e>, Schools(gun free zones) are the answer to F&F. What a putz.  #2012debate 3530
 I'm at work. What did <e>Obama</e> do that made everyone lose their shit? 3532
 The press room busted out laughing when <e>Obama<e> said <a>" my pension isnt as big as yours "</a> LOL , Good comeback dawg ! 3533
 @DivaStateOvMind I don't even care about all of this forreal....but <e>Obama</e> won this one! lol....Kilt that perfect hair Mitt! lol 3534
 Every American that I follow is obviously impressed that <e>Obama</e> is president.. -___- 3535
 <e>Obama</e> says he believes in self reliance? What a joke! He believes in a nanny state! 3537
 #PresDebate There! Obama said it. The 47 percent. His closer. 3538
 And Democrats finally breathe as Obama says "47 percent" 3539
 Notice how <e>Obama</e> didn't need to be told to stop. 3540
 Much better <e>Obama</e> 3541
 <e>Obama</e> wins, hands down! #current2012 3542
 I just want <e>Obama</e> to read a bedtime story to me. I love listening to him <a>speak</a>. 3543
 Oh, so now <e>Obama</e> cares about the <a>military</a>? That's funny, wasn't he just photographed saluting Marines while on the phone? Right. #BS 3544
 <e>Obama</e> is so cute! :') I love him. 3545
 <e>President Obama</e> Is Great Man && He Deserves More Respect Then Romney Is Giving Him ! 3546
<e>Obama</e> is now pandering! Since when does he believe in free enterprise? 3547
 Yay <e>President Obama</e> did it hands down!!!! Yeah buddy 3548
 <e>Obama</e> kicked ass in this debate in my opinion. #debates 3549
 Black people make up a bunch of bullshit excuses to cover up the fact that they voting for <e>Obama</e> kuz he black lol that sh** be too hilarious 3551
 I will never stop loving watching the First Couple.  No one can ever say that <e>Obama</e> doesn't love his wife! #debate 3553

 <e>Obama</e> killed it man. Good job on proving that factual error by your opponent. I'm proud.  3557
 "And that's how you debate biatch" - <e>President Obama</e> as he looks at Romney and drops the mic and leaves the stage. #DNC2012 #GOP2012 #tcot 3559
 <e>Obama's</e> most important job is CINC. He failed in his mission with <a>Benghazi</a>. He lost. He should be fired. Everything else is window dressing. 3560
 <e>Obama</e> must have gotten really high <a>oral</a> marks in english when he was in highschool. Probably roasted the fuck out of everyone. 3561
 Classic <e>all the moderators</e> thus far have all been die hard liberals pulling for Obama and Mitt still wrecks him. 3563
 Romney asking <e>Obama</e> if he has funds offshore, Obama's face was like bitch I barely got funds inshore lol 3564
 @Ed @stevenportnoy @ABCNewsRadio I cant believe my ears!! What is wrong with people? They are so pro <e>Obama</e> they are def and blind 3565

 Great debate performance by <e>President Obama</e>! Much improved from last time 3573
 <e>Obama</e> won that #debate hands down!!! Vote @barackobama!!! 3574
 @MonicaBrown FYI 47 percent are ecstatic about <e>President Obama's</e> performance tonight Mitt Romney. Our President is the truth! 3575
 @Foobian no matter who the fuck our president is and I think that if <e>Obama</e> stays in office that things will get better eventually... 3576
 Everyone seems so close minded, either <e>Obama</e> or no one and that's it and that makes you ignorant, we need to know both sides 3577
 <e>Obama</e> - Same rudeness and arrogance that has been part and parcel of this presidency. Vote the bum out. 3578
 Very impressed with <e>#Obama</e> tonight. Much more engaged and prepared. No doubt about my vote #ObamaBiden2012 3579

 Debate No. 1: Dems admit Obama lost. Debate No. 2: Republicans cry that the moderator wasn't fair. #manup 3587

 Voting for <e>#Obama</e> im behind him a 1,000,000% 3593
 <e>Obama</e> always linked <a>Benghazi</a> to Cairo in order to link it with the video. He clearly did not call it a planned act or terrorism. 3594
 I want <e>Obama</e> b/c I look forward to my daughter growing up & saying, "Ugh. We don't have enough men on staff. Go get my binders full of men." 3595
 @AceofSpadesHQ @jaycosttws @michellemalkin @noltenc "No acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great nation..."-<e>Pres. Obama</e> 3596

 @EmilyPurserSky <e>Obama</e> fought for his job last night and he may have convinced voters to give him another shot! @JCBua @SkyNews 3598

@seanhannity This is a great question for Romney to rebutt <e>Obama's</e> negative <a>ads...</a> 5450
AK-47's used in <a>"gang</a> <a>banging",</a> as <e>Obama</e> put it, are not purchased legally in the US.  Assault Rifle ban does not solve that prob. #Admend2 5451
The One Thing I Can Say And I Salute <e>Obama</e> For Is The Fact That He Has Remained <a>HUMBLE</a> Throughout This Entire Election And Debate . 5452
Weh him just seh? The whole time he's been trying to <a>bash</a> <e>Obama,</e> shut dat sxxt up!!! 5453
I think <e>Obama's</e> <a>sincere</a> #ilikehim 5454
<e>Obama</e> must take advantage of <a>47%</a> now 5455
While <e>Obama</e> has been staying on <a>topic</a> and doing what he's suppose to be doing and that is... 5456
For the idyotsss complaining how <e>Obama</e> ain't get us out of <a>debt</a> why the fuck don't u tell ME what YOU'D do to fix the shit then? Hahn?! 5457
This <e>moderator</e> needs <e>Obama</e> to <a>win</a> so the government forces her to lose weight 5458
<e>Obama</e> looks <a>foolish</a> on the China issue! 5459
Sidenote: <e>Obama's</e> <a>profile</a> is sexy....Now back to the debate. 5460
<e>Romney</e> is an <a>ignorant</a> mofo!!! #TeamObama 5461
We're all children of the same God say ROmeny.  Except <e>Obama.</e>  He's the <a>devil</a>  #debates 5462
I hope <e>Obama</e> <a>responds</a> with "i didn't say you didn't care about 100% of the ppl. You did." 5463
So if government doesn't create <a>job</a> #mittswordsThen how is it <e>Obama's</e> fault there is no job growth 5464
if we gave Bush 8 years to fuck our shit, we give <e>Obama</e> 8 years to <a>fix</a> it. #TeamObama 5465
Same God? <e>Obamacare?</e> Did <e>Romney</e> suddenly switch <e>sides?</e> <a>#debate</a> 5466
OKAY when is Mitt <e>Romney</e> going to <a>tell</a> us what's HE'S going to do instead of what President Obama didn't do." 5467
It seem like <e>Obama</e> never really have time to <a>make</a> his <a>point</a> but Romney do ?? 5468
Y'all see how <e>Obama</e> actually explained to us what he PLANS to do for corporate tax rates. Romney still hasnt told us any of his <a>plans</a> yet... 5469
#nbcPolitics I looove how <e>Romney</e> is <a>trashing</a> Obama. #RomneyNation #Romney2012 5470

Hell yes! He came through and punched DOWN! RT @TiaraSoBoojie: Do you guys feel like <e>Obama</e> <a>reclaimed</a> his victory with this debate?? 5473
Barack <e>Obama,</e> Shawn Carter, & Sean Combs have to be the <a>COOLEST</a> OLD' HEADS in the world! #TRUTH 5474
<e>Obama</e> just <a>lying</a> now. 5475
<e>Obama</e> can <a>come</a> to my house, I'll dye his hair and feed him tons of food. 5476
<e>Romney</e> is a genuinely <a>nice</a> guy. He has a great record in MASS. What does Obama have again? Oh, right. 5477
@ResCon1 Romney <a>said</a> <e>Obama</e> is responsible 4 the security failures that killed our pple in Libya,Obama said nothing.#theblaze2012 #debates 5478
@danielleverde lol <e>@BarackObama</e> <a><e>got</e></a> this in the bag! He was the president of debate at Harvard! This what he do! <e>Romney</e> is full of <e>lies!</e> 5479
@applejacks_hunt @joeymask1 Race has nothing to do with it I actually favored <e>Obama</e> against McCain..but everything he said was <a>lies..</a> 5480
<e>Obama</e> needs to shut up, he made our <a>economy</a> shit 5481
Aaaand <e>Romney</e> is still an <a>idiot.</a> #NoSpecifics #CantAnswerHow #Obama2012 5482
<e>Obama</e> believes in risk takers being rewarded - except when the <a>reward</a> exceeds government mandated levels. #debates 5483
My grandparents think <e>Obama</e> is the <a>antichrist</a> 5484
<e>Obama</e> believes in <a>Free</a> <a>Enterprise,</a> but "everybody should have a fair shot" 5485
@Crystal_Wright That's right! In fact there are 900,00 AA female entrepreneurs in the US now who <a>aren't</a> <a>dissatisfied</a> with President <e>Obama!</e> 5486
<e>Obama</e> is now saying he is a republican. He is right that there needs to be more free market an less gov <a>control.</a> That's what republicans do 5487
If <e>Obama</e> is re-elected, I'm going to purchase my first <a>gun.</a>  End of story.  #RomneyRyan2012 5488
<e>Obama:</e> I <a>believe</a> Gov Romney's a good man #debate #classy 5489

They both got good ideas but <e>obama</e> is the president we need to keep moving <a>forward</a> #Obama2012 5496
#winning <e>Obama</e> mentioned the <a>47%!!</a> Wooooo! #debate 5497
<a>47%</a> is finally brought up by <e>Obama.</e> #Boom 5498
<e>Obama</e> sort of walked into that one. Romney said that all Obama does is attack him. Obama stands up and <a>attacks</a> him. 5499
#debate "there are some <a>jobs</a> that won't come back". <e>Obama.</e> Get off your ass and make corp. <a>Taxes</a> competative, and stop blocking anwar. 5500
Once again <e>Obama</e> is not <a>answering</a> the question 5501
LOL. <e>Obama</e> saved the best for the last. <a>47%.</a> 5502
<a>47</a> PERCENT. <e>Obama</e> runs with it. At last. #PrezDebate2 5503

<e>Obama</e> is going all <a>Biden</a> on Romney's ass. 5505
I may be slightly biased as I really don't like the republican way of life - but I think <e>Obama</e> <a>won</a> the debate on substance #debates 5506
<e>Obama</e> has done nothing for vets but <a>insult</a> them. 5507
FINALLY! I knew he was saving it for the last! <e>Obama</e> mentions the <a>47%.</a> #PMTdebate 5508
<e>#Obama's</e> literally putting me to <a>sleep</a> #townhalldebate 5509
Proud of <e>Obama</e> for <a>reminding</a> everyone of what Romney has said. #sorrynotsorry 5510
Oven <e>Mitt</e> is just <a>destroying</a> Obama #Bravo 5511
But <e>Obama</e> gets final word on <a>47%</a> #fourmoreyears 5512
<e>Obama</e> <a>won</a> that ! 5513
The last 4 years didn't work out like <e>Obama</e> <a>promised,</a> it's time to move on and give Mitt Romney the chance to fix these mistakes #addebate2 5514
<e>Obama</e> <a>did</a> great! 5515
The only way I would vote for <e>Obama</e> is if he <a>banded</a> soccer from The United States . 5516
<e>Obama's</e> passionate last <a>answer</a> was worth watching this whole slugfest.  #OFA_VA #OFA #debate  Great job, Mr. President! 5517

@TeamSID http://t.co/sBmoHkZu not so sure about that. <e>Obama</e> is a 64.4 percent favorite in the <a>forecast</a> 5523
<e>Obama</e> <a>killed</a> that one. Killed it. 5524
<e>Obama</e> 4 more <a>years!!!</a> 5525

<e>Obama</e> just went in for the kill with Romney's <a>47%</a> comments.#winning #debate 5533
Once again, <e>Obama</e> get 4 <a>more</a> <a>minutes</a> 5535
Romney brings up the same points over and over again and tries to make them relevant. <e>Obama</e> brings up relevant points to <a>answer</a> questions. 5536

Solid <a>47%</a> reference <e>Obama.</e> That really was a scumbag thing to say 5542
Romney 40:50 and <e>Obama</e> 44:04. Wonder how many times Obama and Crowley <a>shouted</a> Mitt down. 5543
<e>Obama,</e> you better save that <a>47%</a> comment to close out your argument!!! 5544

#autograpgh <e>Obama</e> <a>signing</a> autograpghs like he is some rock star... give me a break. 5580
@LatinosMatter: <e>#Obama</e> MOPS THE FLOOR with #Mitt Romney!!!! Yes he <a>did!</a> 5581
<e>Obama</e> brought the <a>grit</a> tonight. I'm proud. 5582
<e>Michelle</e> Obama is one tall <a>bitch!</a> 5583
Very well played by <e>Obama</e> to save the <a>47%</a> comments for last....great <a>performance</a> tonight, made me proud 5584
<e>Obama</e> <a>won</a> this! #handsdown 5585
What an intense, tension filled debate. Libya moment was deciding moment, <e>Obama</e> <a>wins</a> this one. Obama came to play tonight. #obama2012 5586
Bottom line, <e>Romney</e> <a>did</a> a great job tonight of reminding people of the failed Obama policies over the past 4 years. 5587
So <e>Obama</e> has a Morgan Freeman narrated <a>commercial.</a>  #itsover #hewins 5588
These <e>people</e> don't care, they just want <a>pictures</a> taken with Obama. 5589
<e>Obama</e> is <a>doing</a> the best he can for the mess of a country he got handed! #Obama2012 5590
<e>Romney</e> not even <a>letting</a> Obama talk 5591
@CadenHaynes because <e>Obama</e> is a <a>beast.</a> 5592
<e>Obama</e> <a>Wins</a> by a landslide! :) 5593
Exactly! RT"@CharlesMBlow: Obama saves "47%" for the last two minute so that <e>Romney</e> couldn't <a>respond.</a> #crafty #debate" 5594
<e>Obama</e> <a>won</a> this debate as soon at Romeny opened his mouth! 5595
Is it just me or did <e>Obama's</e> <a>hair</a> get whiter during the debate?...lol 5596
Of course Mr <e>Obama</e> waits to bring up <a>47%</a> at the end when @MittRomney can't explain! Wow worried #potus? 5597
If <e>Obama</e> don't <a>win</a> this debate.......real Nigga shit......I'm gonna burn to house down. 5598
What's funny is, I think Mr. <e>Romney</e> <a>did</a> better this debate. Raising your voice and saying Obamacare a lot in first debate was not a victory. 5599
I'm pretty sure any president that took over after Bush would've had the same <a>difficulties</a> as <e>Obama.</e> Give him another four tears to fix it 5600
<e>Obama</e> verbally <a>hit</a> him with that uppercut. 5601
It was <a>nice</a> of <e>Obama</e> to show up for the debate this time. 5602
@Slate <e>Obama</e> <a>won</a> Romney got blitzed. Though I am voting for Obama I thought Romney won the first. 5603
Ig I'm the only one who <a>doesn't</a> <a>like</a> <e>Obama.</e> 5604
Thanks for <a>showing</a> up this time <e>Obama,</e> it's nice to have you back. #Obama2012 #forward 5605
<e>Mitt</e> and <e>Obama</e> are gonna go home and continued this <a>debate</a> on Skype 5606
Although <e>romney</e> didnt do as bad as <e>obama</e> in the 1st debate, I see it as <a>1-1</a> Obama won this round, next is boca raton. 5607
#debates <e>Obama</e> really clear <a>winner</a> 5608
My dad annoys me with how much he thinks <e>Obama</e> is like satan and <a>evil.</a> #chill #hesnotplottingtodestroytheuniverse 5609
<e>@BarackObama</e> just <a>punch</a> Romney in the. diiicck! 5610
@GaymerCon So <e>Obama</e> could <a>sweep</a> <a>in</a> and save the day. 5611
Did anyone notice <e>Obama</e> and his wife <a>patting</a> each others back? Really? 5612
Oops my husband just said <e>Obama</e> <a>mopped</a> the <a>floor</a> with this one! 5613
& u look like a non muthaf*ckin factor RT @realDonaldTrump: <e>Obama</e> is looking rhetorical and <a>weak.</a> @MittRomney is looking strong and sharp 5614
<e>YObama</e> so ratchet, he was bouta <a>punch</a> dat Romney nigga in the throat least 8 times 5615
@WSJ <e>Obama</e> <a>won</a> and he won Big!!! 5616
@CNBC2012 <e>Obama</e> may have won the battle but will he win the war?  4 more years of Obama is 4 more years of <a>Failure.</a> 5617
@ZainMotani <e>Obama</e> can <a>free</a> Boosie with a pardon at the end of his presidency. #wipemedown 5618
Mitt stuck his chin out and <e>Obama</e> <a>punched</a> it -Chris Matthews 5619
I <a>hate</a> that the <e>reporters</e> reporting after the debate are getting on President Obama! 5620
<e>Obama</e> <a>took</a> out the elite four with a metapod and no pokedex, they wouldn't even let Romney through the front door. 5621
What if <e>Obama</e> and <e>Biden</e> were able to tag <a>team</a> during the debate... 5622
He stuck his chin out and <e>Obama</e> <a>punched</a> him hard. #Obama2012 #debate 5623
#the <e>debate</e> is <a>boring</a> to watch after a while. I get tired of hearing Obama go ummm, ughhhh, and well actually... #anoying 5624
Amazing that <e>Obama</e> would seek to dodge Benghazi and Romney would let him. In the end, Obama said the <a>buck</a> stops with him. True statement... 5625
is <e>Obama</e> trying to debate about guns? he doesn't know a thing about <a>guns</a> and that's #fact 5626
@BenjaminWavey that sounded racist against my own race hahaha but I meant I'm <a>team</a> <e>Obama.</e> And yes! 5627
@gretawire I felt bad for <e>Obama,</e> he lost 2 <a>debates</a> .His record  looks bad. 5628
HA RT @SwinCash: #Welp President <e>Obama</e> hit em with the <a>47</a> percent like the UpperCut heard around the world.. Then drops the mic... *Tears* 5629
@Larrys_Bitch seeing as I'm canadian& don't know as much about america as you do, all I have to say is my family would be <a>voting</a> for <e>Obama.</e> 5630
@IChogan @Yo_Floyd <e>Obama</e> had more sense, less God. Simple <a>fact.</a> 5631
That <a>debate</a> was like <e>Obama</e> being the bus driver & Romney being that rude bitch. 5632
@papchuseyo <e>Obama</e> <a>sucks...</a> 5633
@BrettMineer: <e>Obama</e> needs to end on <a>47%!</a> Just for fun! #hofdebate #Romney #Obama he did and very well too. 5634
Pres. <e>Obama</e> handled this <a>debate</a> much better than the first. 5635
Smart move by <e>Obama</e> waiting for the last word to directly address <a>47%.</a> 5636
(President) - Barack <e>Obama</e> <a>killed</a> it tonight, lets do our parts and keep him in office if you truly support him #Obama2012 5637

Mamas dont let your babies <a>grow</a> up to be <e>Obama,</e> let em pick guitars and drive them ol trucks cause cowboys have manners they don't interrupt 5640
I don't think <e>Romney</e> was as terrible as Obama was in the first debate. But it sure felt like he got <a>whupped.</a> 5641
this. RT @_FrenisWorld_: Ok <e>Obama</e> clearly <a>won.</a> Now go to Fox and they'll say Romney won and the moderator was wrong for interrupting Romney. 5642
<e>Obama</e> clearly <a>won</a> that debate 5643
<e>Obama</e> again <a>speaks</a> about four minutes longer than Romney. 5644
<e>Obama</e> <a>shat</a> on Romney. 5645
@CNBC2012 Moderator <e>Candy</e> Crowley is <a>biased!!!</a> You dont interupt Romney so Obama can speak. She shouldnt be allowed to vote!!!! 5646
Yes, it's hard to change a country in 4 years. But <e>Obama</e> knew that when he promised he would do it... And he <a>didn't.</a> 5647
I would say <e>Obama</e> <a>killed</a> it in that one!Obama and Biden: 2Romney and Ryan: 1 5648
<e>Obama</e> <a>Won</a> This Debate . 5649
#hofdebate all the hard work and sacrifice of the Hofstra community and <e>Obama</e> didn't even have the <a>courtesy</a> of acknowledging where he was! 5650
<e>Obama</e> got the trap niggas, hood niggas, twerkers, hoes, dope boys, & weed smokers watching the <a>debate.</a> Name one president who has done that? 5651
Wow <e>Michelle</e> Obama was just in Chapel Hill, now she's at the <a>debate.</a> #SheFlyin 5652
@GMA @ThisWeekABC @GStephanopoulos - I hope y'all won't miss and/or dodge the fact that (a) <e>#Obama</e> <a>LIED</a> and (b) Candy ran interference. 5653
@johncerisola The only reason teenagers like <e>Obama</e> is cause he's <a>black</a> and everyone thinks he's cool and like you just said a thug. Like no. 5654
Stfu. RT @realDonaldTrump: Such long <a>rhetorical</a> and boring answers from <e>Obama.</e> No wonder nothing gets done. 5655
@Evan_Sofa so is <e>Obama</e> but you don't see him <a>bragging</a> about it 5656
<e>Obama</e> <a>won</a> !!!  Send Romny back home 5657
when Obama can't answer a question, he has the <e>moderator</e> <a>save</a> him by changing the subject. 5658
<e>Obama</e> <a>killed</a> itttt. 5659
#debates <e>Obama</e> <a>knows</a> what is needed for this country. Romney is just gonna screw things up by putting his foot in his mouth! 5660
<e>Obama</e> <a>delivered</a> a.bis driver uppercut. Boom!! #debate 5661
<e>Obama</e> exceeded expectations, a low bar set by the last debate, yet he still <a>loses.</a> He's shared no vision for what he'd do w/ 4 more years. 5662
Comparing <e>Obama</e> & Romney's <a>financial</a> aid policies - http://t.co/lS158tgk 5663
<e>I</e> <a>unfollowed</a> her ass for saying team Obama. #thatshitstopstoday 5664
Final minute <a>breakdown</a> for <e>debate:</e> Pres Obama at 43:57, Romney at 40:58 minutes. 5665
<e>Obama</e> is the definition of <a>#Clutch</a> 5666
You fail to realize that <e>Obama</e> is not from the hood. In the <a>hood,</a> your life will suck no matter who the president is. 5667
I think the moment when <e>Obama</e> really showed he was <a>serious</a> was when the Libya subject came up. He took over with fire in his eyes 5668
It's amazing how Romney criticizes <e>@BarackObama</e>  for what he didn't do but his <a>plans</a> will take 5-8 years to see real change. #NOT BACKWARDS! 5669
Good <a>win</a> <e>Obama!!</e> Well won!! #Easy 5670
<a>"Aggressiveness"</a> is not in <e>Obama's</e> character so it seemed misplaced #butthatsjustmethough 5671
@DYANCASTILLEJO <e>Obama,</e> I feel his <a>sincerity.</a> 5672
<e>Obama</e> better give that black guy a hamburger, so he will <a>vote</a> for him again 5673
<e>Obama</e> once again <a>murdered</a> Romney in the Debate Tonight !! #Obama2012 5674
Our viewing party room thinks <e>Obama</e> <a>won</a> this debate. How about you? 5675
Approx Time period: Obama had 43:57. <e>Romney</e> had 40:48. Romney with the <a>win!</a> 5676
Libya issue seemed to be one of the most significant parts of debate... Interesting how <e>Obama</e> <a>owned</a> up to incident after Hillary's comments 5677
<e>Ron</e> <e>Paul</e> could <a>blow</a> both Obama and Romney out of the water in this debate. #nobandwagoner 5678
I really just <a>don't</a> <a>like</a> <e>Obama</e> 5679
<e>Obama</e> was on point. Engaged and <a>strong.</a> Mitt seemed arrogant. 5680
Wether some want to admit it or not, some people just are going to vote for <e>Obama</e> just because he is <a>black.</a> SOME not all 5681
@DevinSullivan21 <e>Obama</e> gon <a>beat</a> yo ass ! 5682

<e>Obama</e> <a>won</a> http://t.co/AqChYUTK via @MarketWatch 5685
@CallMeGrayy true, but the <a>policies</a> <e>Obama</e> has in place haven't worked and he plans to continue them 5686
@dannyajasso I don't know, the <a>Libya</a> question and getting fact-checked from <e>Candy</e> was a big moment to me like Obama's tone 2 wks ago. 5687
<e>Obama</e> should have dropped the mic after that final statement. He completely <a>owned</a> it !! 5688
Great moderation from Candy Crowley. Mitt seemed cranky and exasperated but President <e>Obama</e> was on point and intolerant of <a>bullshit.</a> #debate 5692
Sheesh RT @ColbyMarkel: <e>Michelle</e> Obama should give <a>Colb</a> that mouth 5693
Fuck you if your not <a>voting</a> for <e>Obama!!</e> 5695
Yeah. So i think <e>Obama</e> <a>won</a> this debate. 5696
Contentious, but one is telling the truth and the other is <a>lying.</a> <e>Obama=liar.</e> Romney=truth. 5697
I know y'all won't agree, but I don't care because I love my <a>God.</a> I really think <e>Obama</e> isn't following Him at all and that's the main reason 5698
<e>Obama</e> <a>won</a> that debate hands down. 5699
<e>Obama</e> ended with a knockout. The <a>47%</a> comment = the bus driver uppercut! Dont try to explain, Mittens. Just get off the bus!! #POW! #fb 5700
If to win this debate is to tell the most <a>lies,</a> then <e>Obama</e> won. #townhalldebate 5701
<e>Obama</e> basically <a>made</a> Romney his Bitch! 5702

RT@BarackObama  #RomneyExposed @politicalwire That exchange on Libya was <e>Romney's</e> Gerald Ford moment He was <a>lost</a> and not presidential at all 5708
<e>Romney</e> should have just gone over and just <a>kicked</a> Obama in the shin....lol!! 5709
I don't like <e>Obama.</e> But I voted <a>for</a> him. Because, look at the alternative. #Yikes 5710
Ima start telling people <a>vote</a> for the white side of <e>Obama</e> 5711

I spoke in tandem with <e>Obama</e> on his talking points.  He's not <a>saying</a> anything new 5714
So that was considered the most remarkable date EVER in history??? And <e>Obama</e> <a>won??</a> CHECKMATE!! 5715

Dude, <e>Obama</e> <a>brought</a> it tonight. This is the man who should have been here in the first debate 5727
@chrisrockoz: Mitt Romney: I can't decide which thing <e>Obama</e> did was <a>worse,</a> giving everyone healthcare or saving the auto industry. 5728
@adammott23 <e>Obama</e> is clearly <a>winning!</a> 5730
Even though I'm biased, I'm calling this for Romney, but just barely.  Fact checks will show <e>Obama</e> a <a>liar.</a> #tcot #RomneyRyan2012 #debate 5731

Tonight <e>Obama</e> <a>fought</a> fire with fire but in his cool,  controlled way which makes it much more effective #debate 5734
Obama <e>needed</e> the moderator to <a>bail</a> him out and also called a man named Kerry "Kerr". lol 5735
Debate: we are in trouble no matter which way we go , give <e>Obama</e> <a>4</a> more <a>years.</a> 5736

<e>Mitt,</e> why didn't you just go up and <a>punch</a> Obama straight in the face? 5771
@EmmMacfarlane: Ari Fleischer calls it a flat-out draw"... which means you know what..." Ya. <e>Obama</e> just went <a>Honduras</a> on Romney. #CMNT 5772

People don't even know what <e>Obama</e> doing for us they just saying vote for him cause he <a>black.</a> 5795
Bottom line, <e>Obama's</e> <a>policies</a> have failed for 4 years &, if reelected, there is no reason to expect anything different over the next 4 years 5798
Thank you, President <e>Obama.</e> You <a>speak</a> for me. 5799
<e>Obama</e> needs a <a>vacation.</a> 5800
My take on debate: Obama did better than last debate, but not good enough. <e>Romney</e> held his own. Both had hits & misses, but Romney <a>won.</a> 5801

@BeirutToJupiter Yeah I saw that :) the content of what <e>Romney</e> was saying seemed more <a>prepared</a> than Obama. The Pres. prob. had a busier day. 5809
Last political tweet: don't act like ONLY Obama tries to change the subject on questions asked, Mitt does it too. <e>THEY</e> ALL <a>DO</a> IT. #fact 5810

<e>Obama</e> can't get <a>mad</a> but Romney can? 5823
@ellencarmichael @mittromney Even more disturbing, seemed like <e>Candy</e> set up every topic to leave last <a>word</a> to Obama 5824
